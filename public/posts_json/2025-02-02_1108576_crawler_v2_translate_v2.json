I've been using it very stable in Shenzhen, whether it's China Telecom broadband at home or China Unicom and China Telecom mobile networks. The peak delay is stable within 50ms, and the experience is very enjoyable.\n\nWent back to my hometown in Henan for Chinese New Year, and the next day I found that port 443 was directly blocked, and all normal web pages could not be opened. Cross-comparison revealed that it was the local China Mobile broadband that blocked it. At that time, other ports could still be accessed, so I switched to ss on other ports, thinking of using it temporarily for a few days.\n\nAs a result, after two days, this port also failed. Looking again, I was done for. No matter what network environment or port, I couldn't connect at all. Returning to Shenzhen didn't work either. I did a global ping online and completely gave up. Except for Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign countries, all domestic nodes were red.\n\nFinally, I had to put on a CF shell as a rescue, and now the delay has become 300ms, with obvious lag, and the experience is very unpleasant.\n\nI can only sigh, the construction of the local network in my big Henan is far ahead."
