          "en": "I'm currently working on a small project. My colleague only repeats jargon and talks about the macro framework. When asked about specific details, he stutters, or even makes up answers. His strength is that he's very good at interpersonal relationships. When I first joined the project and hadn't started practical work, I was indeed bluffed by him. The longer we work together, the more I realize he's a slacker: he appears to be very hardworking, and even stays late to work overtime every day. In reality, he doesn't do any work at all, and his ability is ridiculously poor. Often, he needs me to explain the thinking behind even small tasks to him step by step. Work reports rely on fabrication and plagiarism.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the leader doesn't understand the technical details, which gives him a lot of room to play. He speaks eloquently in front of the leader, repeating jargon over and over again, and really fools the leader. Coupled with his ability to handle things, the leader has a good impression of him. He's always smiling at colleagues and project management, and accepts criticism and scolding with a sincere attitude every time, but it's still the same afterwards. He presents himself as a good-tempered, hardworking, and nice person to outsiders.\r\n\r\nI'm just a small soldier, and I can't command him at all, but I don't want to give up this project. Thinking about having to cooperate with him again when I go back after the Spring Festival, I feel very irritable. Brothers, do you have any coping methods without quitting the project?"
