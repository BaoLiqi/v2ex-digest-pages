          "en": "Don't blindly criticize LLMs if you don't understand them. The core of a large language model is language expression. Simply put, it's just learning to speak after reading a massive amount of digital materials. Anything related to calculations and real-world problems, whether it's GPT or Gemini, can actually be wrong. Both GPT and Gemini need multimodal methods to perform calculations. They need to understand the text, convert it into code, execute the calculation, and then give you the answer. I tested it, and Gemini can answer this question correctly and create the correct table. The language model itself still cannot know what the exact answer is. Because this is not the multiplication table. There are no pre-trained materials that can include listing all the rational interest rates of all natural number deposits after all natural years. This question is really boring and there's no need to get hung up on it. It's meaningless. The LLM should be judged by whose language skills are better. Who is good and who is bad cannot be measured by a simple mathematical problem. It requires a lot of application scenarios for comparative testing. In my daily work, I use 4.0, Gemini and domestic large models in both Chinese and English. Each has its own advantages. It's really boring to criticize just for the sake of criticizing."
