          "en": "I'm currently studying in France and found a three-person shared apartment for cheap, but one of my roommates is a total man-child.\nThis person is a second-year master's student, at least 25 years old physically, but his behavior and logic are completely childlike.\nThis morning I woke up and opened the door to a terrible smell. It turned out the pot was burnt. His explanation was that he set a timer for the stove, but it didn't seem to work, and then he left... Another roommate who woke up earlier turned off the fire. After saying that, his eyes went back to the screen, which was showing a game. No apology either...\nThe kitchen sink is constantly piled with his pots and pans, and he only washes them when he cooks, I've told him five or six times, but he doesn't listen. Every time he finishes cooking, he rushes back to his room to play games, and even when he is cooking, he's playing games and doesn't watch the stove. Several times, other roommates have helped him turn off the fire.\nHe plays games and voice chats late at night, and ignores me even after I've told him several times to stop.\nHe leaves his clothes in the washing machine for two or three days after they're washed.\nHis family sent him abroad to study after the Gaokao (National College Entrance Examination), and I guess he had never been in the kitchen before being sent abroad. He knows nothing about kitchen safety and hygiene.\nTonight, I called him out of his room to warn him not to mess up the kitchen again. He also looked at you with one eye and the game on the screen with the other, his mind is only on the game.\nIf you talk to him nicely, he will only agree to everything in order to quickly go back to playing games. I'm too lazy to use any harsh tricks to deal with him. If it really doesn't work, I'll just move out and rather spend more money. Talking to this kind of man-child is a waste of life.\n\nVenting to you v2ex users, and also to witness the wonders of the world."
