          "en": "It feels like there's a bit less communication. He's not your direct leader, and he sits beside you, so you can communicate more and get to know each other better. It's like college roommates – you didn't know each other before, had different backgrounds, and when you first lived together, there were some bumps, so there was a period of adjustment because both sides had blind spots in their personalities. You can discuss this topic face-to-face, or you can gradually get to know him through more contact. After you've talked it through and broken down the blind spots, maybe the other person can adjust their way of interacting. Thinking about myself, after four years of college, those roommates who I had some friction with are still close friends now. Judging from some of the specific examples you mentioned, he's relatively focused on details in his work, but he doesn't pay much attention to the details of emotions. For example, he may not perceive your emotions? Venting on the screen is also a kind of crudeness, a manifestation of not paying attention to details, but it could also be that he has pressure inside. You can think about it, his point of view for giving suggestions, is it to hope that things will get better, or to force others to be happy? Is it aimed at you personally, or a type of behavior? Is it constructive? He also has his responsibilities, does he exercise his responsibilities in the public interest or for private gain? It's hard for an individual to grasp what kind of colleagues they will meet. The world changes very quickly, and even colleagues who get along well may be adjusted. No matter where you are, there may be all kinds of troubles. We can adjust our way of looking at problems and do some decompression. Emotions are a combination of perception and internal processing. On the one hand, half a glass of water can have different views, and on the other hand, he’s venting on the screen as a way of decompression, and you can also have your own way of decompression (such as communicating with us here), or even complain with him together :) Sometimes it's really better to just think open-mindedly. Open up your perspective. It's not a big deal in the long run."

But there's a situation you need to be vigilant about; you have to analyze it deeply, is he just seeing you in a bad light and arguing with you, or is it because what you're doing doesn't suit him that he's criticizing you?
