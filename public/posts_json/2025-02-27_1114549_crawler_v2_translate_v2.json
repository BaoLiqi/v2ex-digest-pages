Basically, we can't get in touch with them.\r\n5: According to the business license, I complained to the market supervision department. The merchants either can't be contacted or say they have no money to compensate. The market supervision bureau also suggested filing a lawsuit.\r\n6: The orders are too scattered, more than 300 orders. The anchors change shops every two broadcasts, and the amount of money in each shop is not high, making it too troublesome to file a lawsuit.\r\n7: The anchor accounts also change every three days. If they are reported, they just change their accounts. The system recommendation mechanism will still push them to fans, and even prepare in advance, diverting traffic to small accounts before they are banned.\r\n8: At this moment, these people are still broadcasting and selling goods, some on Kwai, and some have been diverted to WeChat. Reporting to WeChat is also like a stone sinking into the sea, and it doesn't affect their daily live broadcast harvesting of these elderly people at all.\r\n9: According to my observation, there are hundreds of thousands of similar victims. CCTV has also reported it, but I don't know why no one cares."
