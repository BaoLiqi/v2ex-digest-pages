          "en": "@punching2012 #7 There are situations where you need to make reservations for meals, but think about it the other way around, do people who work and live in Japan make reservations for every meal? That's not realistic either. High-end restaurants require reservations, but you can still eat casual meals doge and won't go hungry. #11 Communication with translation software is basically enough. What you need to pay attention to is to prepare to enable roaming service, or buy a local SIM card, or rent a Wi-Fi device, in order to ensure that your network connection doesn't get cut off. If all else fails, Chinese people are everywhere. If you talk to the air, Chinese NPCs will randomly appear to help you. Besides the famous spots, spend more time doing what ordinary people do, like experiencing life in a different place for a day—go to the supermarket, take the subway and wander around (citywalk), visit ordinary restaurants/cafes/bakeries/hotels/supermarkets/parks, there are some details that are completely different from the experience in China, which are quite interesting. Don't necessarily aim to complete any KPI-like goals when visiting the famous spots. Note that hotels generally allow check-in after 2 p.m.; subways and other transfers in Tokyo city are more complicated, download subway software in advance and familiarize yourself with the interface (Google Map is also very useful). Some transportation tickets can be bought as a pass/through ticket, which is much cheaper, so make a plan in advance. (Personal tip) Wandering around aimlessly is a better experience than squeezing with the crowd at the famous spots."

          "en": "I lived in Japan for a year. Food: Low-end three major restaurants, Sukiya, Yoshinoya, and Matsuya, all have ordering machines and Chinese options, with an average of less than 50 CNY per person. For mid-range and high-end restaurants, check Google Maps or Tabelog. Note that Japanese people usually default the rating to 3 stars. Shops with 4 stars+ on Google Maps are basically tourist-oriented and not recommended, as they may have different menus for tourists. High-end restaurants usually require reservations. Shops that are unwilling to serve non-Japanese-speaking customers usually occur in high-end traditional restaurants. Payment: Only a small number of small shops accept cash only. Chain stores can all be paid by card. In terms of compatibility, VISA is the best, followed by AMEX (it is unnecessary to apply for a JCB card specifically, as JCB and AMEX have a mutual recognition agreement in Japan). Many domestic credit cards have high cashback rates for offline spending abroad, which is more cost-effective than WeChat Pay and Alipay. Transportation: iPhones can open Suica and support UnionPay credit card top-ups. If you are traveling with friends who use Android phones, you can open an Icoca or Passmo card. There is no difference for tourists. Note that in rural areas such as Kyushu and Okinawa, you need to buy tickets with cash. For first-time independent travel, unless you need to take the Shinkansen, it is not recommended to buy any passes or one-day tickets, because the discounts for lines such as JR, Metro, and private railways are complex, and it is easy to lose money if you do not strictly follow the planned itinerary. Taxis are expensive. If you really want to take a taxi, pay attention that Japanese taxis are driven by the driver who opens and closes the doors. You can use Didi or Uber (which is 500-800 yen more expensive than hailing a taxi). Accommodation: Tokyo and Osaka are always expensive. The hotel tidal effect is obvious in other places. Weekend and holiday room rates are x2, x3 is the norm. In the countryside, such as Sendai, you can stay in a hotel with a hot spring on weekdays for 200 RMB. Himeji 600 can have a private bath + one night and two meals. Sightseeing: Almost all shopping districts and bustling streets in Japan are built around train stations. Even in Tokyo, a 10-minute walk from the station can turn into a rural area."

Google Map 可以搜餐厅，部分餐厅会显示预约等字样，这种需要提前预约的 不然不提供服务。（预约好像需要注册什么账号，太复杂没搞）\t2. 结账时看下前台是不是有收钱的盘子，日本结账一般都是把现金放到盘子里面，付款方式一般是现金、刷卡、部分支持支付宝，微信很少。\t3. 点餐的话指着对应的食物配合“this one”万能，常规英文都能听懂，不行再上翻译，千万不要在乎掉面儿。\t4. 便利店 711 和全家都有自主结账机，东西给店员后，直接在机器投钱就行。大街上买水的机器一大堆 不用担心口渴。5. 游玩\t1. 提前在地图查下路线以及营业时间。\t2. 不是热门景区可以现场买票，热门景点最好提前买票，飞猪和 Booking 都有，Google Map 搜索对应景点也可以查看票务信息。\t3. 寺庙有些内堂需要脱鞋进入，准备好舒适的鞋袜。\t4. 日本寺庙和神社不要瞎拜，不知道里面供奉的什么玩意。6. 其他事项\t1. 建议办理一个 visa 或者 master ，银联卡应用范围比较小。\t2. 出门随身带着护照、现金和银行卡。\t3. 日元兑换一个人建议兑换 5 万日元即可，两个人兑换十万以下够用了。\t4. 提前买流量卡，日本也有免费的公共 WiFi ，到景区和机场、商场之类的可以打开 WiFi 搜索。",
          "en": "1. Air tickets and airport departure 1. It is recommended to choose Fliggy (飞猪), compare it with Qunar (去哪儿). International flights on Fliggy are about 300-400 yuan cheaper. (You can also compare other platforms) You can check the prices of the day before and after, sometimes the difference is quite large. 2. When purchasing international flights, you need to fill in your passport information, so you need to apply for a passport in advance. 3. International flights require border inspection, and domestic international flights must check in at the counter. It is recommended to arrive at the airport 3 hours in advance to check in. (Air China can pre-select seats on the mini program, which requires PhoenixMiles miles or 50 yuan) 4. The border inspection will ask some basic questions (where to go, electronic visa, \"whether to work \"just say whatever you want, no detailed investigation\", return flight, hotel itinerary, etc.) You can pass the inspection in three or four minutes. 5. The entry form can be filled electronically, search Visit Japan Web on Google, or <font size=4, color='yellow'>bring a pen</font> and fill it out on the plane. (It is recommended to fill in the paper form, because I don't know where my electronic form failed, so I was asked to refill the paper one) 2. Hotel 1. Platforms to choose from: Fliggy, Booking, Agoda and other platforms. Focus on comparing prices and reviews. Don't choose hotels that are too close to the train station, the tracks will be noisy. Choose a central location within one kilometer of the train station based on where you want to visit. 2. When choosing a hotel, select the actual number of guests. The room rate is charged according to the actual number of guests. Check whether the price includes tax. If it is not included, some hotels need to pay consumption tax at the front desk when checking in. Check whether WiFi is provided. 3. It is recommended to choose a more upscale hotel, as the communication and service at the front desk will be relatively higher, and the communication and check-in experience will be much better. 4. Except for towels, other disposable daily necessities are basically placed in the lobby, and will not be pre-arranged in the room. 5. The domestic voltage in Japan is 110v. When carrying domestic appliances and electronic products, pay attention to the input power of the charger. Mobile phones and other devices can be charged directly without an adapter. High-power devices need to buy a transformer. 6. Some hotel TV programs are charged. It is best to check the check-in guide in the room and the TV prompt information. Don't watch it if you don't need to, otherwise you will be charged when checking out. 7. The toilet paper in the hotel can be flushed directly, and there are special bags for sanitary napkins. 8. Basic check-in at the hotel is after 2 p.m., and check-out is before 11 a.m. Luggage storage is provided. 3. Travel in Japan 1. You can get an electronic transportation card in your iPhone wallet, and top it up as much as you use. Moreover, the transportation card can be used to buy things, and convenience stores and shopping malls can all be used. 2. Japanese subways are divided into express, semi-express, and ordinary. The speeds are different. You need to swipe your card when entering and exiting the station. The express trains require an extra express fee. You can buy it at the station or someone on the train will confirm it with you. You just need to pay directly. Some streetcars have a fixed price for the entire journey. You don't swipe your card when you get on, but swipe it when you get off. Please search for precautions on Xiaohongshu (小红书) in advance when taking the JR line (generally for airports or long distances) and buses. 3. It is recommended to use Google Map. The information about transfers and train times is very detailed, and you can also book restaurants. 4. Important point: they don't have security checks, not even at the airport. 5. Buy a wallet with a zipper, otherwise you won't have a place to put your coins. Carry a bag when you go out, there is really not much place to throw garbage. 4. Eating 1. You can search for restaurants on Google Map. Some restaurants will show words like reservation, which requires you to make a reservation in advance, otherwise they will not provide service. (It seems that you need to register an account to make a reservation, which is too complicated and I didn't figure it out) 2. When checking out, check if there is a tray for receiving money at the front desk. Japanese people usually put cash into the tray. Payment methods are generally cash, card, and some support Alipay, but WeChat is rare. 3. When ordering food, it is versatile to point to the corresponding food and say “this one”. Regular English can be understood. If not, then use a translation app. Don't care about losing face. 4. Convenience stores 711 and FamilyMart have self-checkout machines. After giving the items to the clerk, you can put the money directly into the machine. There are a lot of machines for buying water on the street, so you don't need to worry about being thirsty. 5. Sightseeing 1. Check the route and business hours on the map in advance. 2. You can buy tickets on the spot for non-popular scenic spots. It is best to buy tickets for popular scenic spots in advance. Fliggy and Booking all have them. You can also check the ticket information by searching for the corresponding scenic spot on Google Map. 3. Some temples require you to take off your shoes to enter the inner hall, so prepare comfortable shoes and socks. 4. Don't worship Japanese temples and shrines blindly. You don't know what is enshrined inside. 6. Other matters 1. It is recommended to apply for a Visa or Mastercard, as UnionPay cards are not widely used. 2. Carry your passport, cash, and bank card with you when you go out. 3. It is recommended that one person exchange 50,000 yen, and two people can exchange less than 100,000 yen. 4. Buy a data SIM card in advance. Japan also has free public WiFi. You can turn on WiFi and search when you go to scenic spots, airports, and shopping malls."

Unless you make a reservation, people generally like to use Suica for direct entry and exit, so they prefer express trains. However, the experience of riding the Shinkansen and limited express trains is indeed better. The trains are also more beautiful. - Unless a low-probability event occurs, Google Maps navigation can tell you the platform number. So you can directly use Google Maps for the train, enter the station with Suica, and get on the corresponding platform. I've encountered temporary track changes (items left on the platform, station malfunction) twice at small stations. If you don't know Japanese, you can only ask the staff. - There will be Japanese staff who can speak Chinese at international airports and large train stations. But in small places, there may not be one at the subway station. Practice your English. If you are in a big city or a popular tourist destination, it's actually easy to run into Chinese people. - Most Japanese people I've met can speak English, and even very old drivers have very standard accents. - It's best to make a reservation for popular restaurants. Some places may require you to wait until after 10:00 pm without a reservation. But reservations are quite inflexible. The number of people you reserve for must match the number of people who go. Ordinary shops don't matter. If you are traveling alone, reservations will indeed be limited. - There are very few breakfast shops in Japan. If your hotel doesn't include breakfast, you can only go to a convenience store. - You can get tax-free shopping for purchases over 5000 yen, so remember to bring your passport before shopping. - Prepare a small coin purse, as there are many places that use cash.

          "en": "@icecream There are many pink salons near the exits of Sugamo and Otsuka stations. You can search for ピンクサロン on Google Maps. I explored them in December. The shops near Otsuka refused foreigners, but the ones near Sugamo were okay. This is super cheap, you can experience it for about 3,000 yen (in the daytime). You can Google the services inside, but the overall age of the girls is relatively older, but the techniques are very good. The only traditional, legitimate bonban shop in Tokyo is Yoshiwara. Come out of the Google Sanno-rind station, then search for \"Senryu\", and walk a kilometer or so to the red-light district, and then explore on your own. For the first time, I recommend 60 minutes. The prices are between 25,000 and 50,000 yen. I usually spend more than 20,000 yen in a shop, and the basic service is still okay, but the appearance of the girls may not be the best. The higher the price, the better they look. My friend played a 120-minute session for 90,000 yen before, and he said it was particularly beautiful. Generally, someone will greet you at the door, and 80% of foreigners can spend money. Foreigner fee + 5,000 yen. If you are good at Japanese, you can negotiate not to pay this extra fee, but if the person says that foreigners are not allowed, don't negotiate, just walk away. Japanese people dislike those who don't respect the rules. You need to learn this sentence in Japanese, 外人でも大丈夫？ Gai Jin Dei Mo Dai Jou bu? (Gai Jin Dei Mo Dai Jou bu?) Ask at the entrance if they accept foreigners, otherwise everything is equal to zero. In addition, the negative reviews on Google Maps are still worth referring to, because Japanese people will write reviews after they are done. The two places I have played are for your reference."
