          "en": "Work-related, I haven't had a single quiet evening since the fourth day of the Lunar New Year. Every night when I rest, I'm terrified: What if another company comes out with something new, and I have to drop everything to work?\r\n\r\nMy boss is acting like he's possessed. He's been tagging us in the group chat on Saturday mornings at 7 AM to assign work. My personal work has also become very disorganized, and the pace of change is too fast. The previous task is still waiting to be scheduled, and the next task arrives and needs to be completed immediately. I often receive tasks at 9 or 10 PM and have to finish them by the next morning.\r\n\r\nAs a basic-level drone, I may not be able to empathize with my boss's grand vision. I'm also really annoyed that the large model industry has become like this. What's the point of everyone fighting over each other? Especially when they release things on weekends or in the middle of the night, you guys are really annoying. Model companies are trying to grab the 'industry first,' and we, as peripheral companies, have to grab the 'first release.' When will this end?\r\n\r\nFaced with the rapidly developing large model industry, some people may be very excited, as if they are the navigators of the new era, but I only feel tired and irritable. I just want to live a good life as an ordinary worker. AI is good enough for me if it's useful. I really don't want to care how advanced it becomes.\r\n\r\np.s. Just complaining, I still have to work. 😮‍💨"
