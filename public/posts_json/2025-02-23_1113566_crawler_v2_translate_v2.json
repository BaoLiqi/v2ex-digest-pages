This is similar to how machines learn languages. Machines don't look up dictionaries or memorize words. To make a machine understand the meaning of a word, you only need to show it how the word is used in a sentence. The famous masked language model (MLM) hides the word and lets the machine look at the context to infer the meaning."

Understand English Sentences with Cutter\r\n\r\nOne problem I encountered when I was in school was that I had memorized English words many times and learned grammar many times, but I still couldn't understand long and difficult sentences. Later, I started practicing learning English through sentences, and I started using a method to break down sentences, decomposing complex long sentences into main components and modifiers to clarify the sentence structure. The general rule is to identify three long structures: clauses, phrases, and non-finite verbs, then mark the parts of speech to find adjectives and adverbs, and finally mark parallel structures."
