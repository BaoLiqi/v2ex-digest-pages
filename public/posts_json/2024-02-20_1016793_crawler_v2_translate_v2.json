The transmission of this car is really smart, but cars are prone to breaking down if they sit unused. For example, you need regular maintenance, and you have to pay thousands of yuan for insurance, engine oil, transmission oil, brake oil, rear axle differential lock oil, etc., every year. Also, the tires can't be left idle; they are prone to deformation and damage. And tires have a lifespan; they need to be replaced every 5-6 years, otherwise, you won't feel at ease on the highway. A blowout is no joke. Before I gave my CX-5 to my dad, I replaced it with 4 Michelin PS4 tires, one costs a thousand yuan. Buying other cheaper ones also costs about 700 yuan. It's best to drive the car once a week to get the engine oil moving, otherwise, it's prone to sediment. I suggest you rent a car when you need to use one; the cost may be cheaper than keeping a car for a year. However, I haven't rented a car during Chinese New Year either; you have to consider everything."
