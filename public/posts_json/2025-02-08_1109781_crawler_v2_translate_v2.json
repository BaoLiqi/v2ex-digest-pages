On October 20, 2024, he suddenly suffered severe lower back pain while sleeping and went to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with kidney stones in both kidneys. The kidney stone in the left kidney was stuck at the entrance of the ureter. Xiao Sun said that after learning that laser lithotripsy would cost 12,000 yuan and that he was very afraid of surgery, he finally decided to rely on drinking water and exercising to pass the kidney stone on his own. He insisted on drinking more than 5 liters of water every day and jogging 5 kilometers. After a month or two of efforts, on February 2 this year (the fifth day of the Lunar New Year), he finally passed the stone of about 9 mm. He plans to frame the stone to remind himself to drink more water at ordinary times."
