A normal old father doesn't dote on his daughter, but your father-in-law has already compromised by coming to your home and constantly cueing you. You still feel like you're losing face. Actually, according to their generation's thinking, they have already given you a way out. Respect your father-in-law, respect your wife, and even more so, respect your responsibility as a man to build a family. What your wife did is not what they say, like your wife went back to accuse and expose you. That's not right. Actually, in the long run, what your wife did is right. If you're bullied, shouldn't you look for your father? It would be stupid not to. What a woman wants is a reliance. You can say that your wife can't stand being wronged and has the temper of a young lady. But you need to solve it, to guide it. This is your responsibility as a man. You have sparked conflict. If you say that you want everyone to be mature, not to disturb each other, and have a sense of boundaries, then why did your wife marry you? To have one less mouth to feed? If you want the family to continue, then admit your mistake, otherwise it will be difficult to end it later.

The family can continue. There's a bit of a contradiction, but mainly you need to resolve it. You go and admit your mistake to your wife and your father-in-law. Your father-in-law is sensible and self-reflects, thinking that young people nowadays have a strong sense of boundaries, and says it's okay with a grin. Of course, it's also possible that he'll take an inch, but that probability is very low. 2: Don't admit your mistake, be tough to the end, at most get a divorce. Over time, one of the two parties wakes up and reduces contact. Anyway, all you and your wife are doing is getting on each other's nerves once something happens. Of course, it's also possible that other things, the birth of the next generation, will erase everything over time. 3: You feel ashamed, you want face. Your dad steps in, teaches you a lesson, and also gives your father-in-law a hint. @flowerfly"
