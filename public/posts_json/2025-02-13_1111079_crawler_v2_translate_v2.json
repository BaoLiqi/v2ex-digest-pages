Plus, many people in the fuel car era didn't choose to install this, so they never came into contact with it, so when they switched to new energy, they felt that the basic version of intelligent driving was a new thing. The truly epoch-making one is fully intelligent driving. It would be smooth if it could be widely popularized within 5 years, which is not the same thing you want to ask."

If it is crashed into scrap, it is their primary responsibility, and it is a rear-end collision. But what if it is a truck? It's useless if you don't have the function of actively avoiding risks. Also, if you say you are staring at it all the time and controlling it at any time, you will find that this function is useless, and you will be more tired. It is better to drive yourself, constantly worrying. Finally, the lane keeping function is only applicable to clearly marked road sections.
