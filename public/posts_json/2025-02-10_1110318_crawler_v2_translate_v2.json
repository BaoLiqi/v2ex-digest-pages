I've encountered a few works that are just so ugly.\r\n\r\nRegarding directly stating that the works are not good-looking, I encountered 2 people who replied that aesthetics and beautification are the responsibility of the designer, and the frontend developer is responsible for implementing the effects (roughly meaning I am a programmer, I write code, aesthetics is not my concern).\r\n\r\nI myself am a backend programmer, and I also write frontend code, but less often.

However, it is difficult to find a mutually understanding team in the current workplace. The vast majority is decided by the project party, and there is not much space given to the landing team, including large mobile phone manufacturers. If a Samsung employee jumps over, it's a different story. Many UIs are transferred from other positions, and they don't know how to implement it. There are many ways to solve a problem. For example, to make an Apple or Tesla or Samsung brand website, there are CSS interpolation animation, video frame extraction, shader animation, physical rendering animation. The choice of solution needs to be coordinated. Domestic art colleges don't have this class. This is why you often see some design drafts that are amazing at first glance, no less than Apple and Samsung's designs, but if you look closely, you always feel a strange taste. When recruiting, you can look for highlights instead of nitpicking, and strive to find advantages. After all, cooperation is about seeking consensus."
