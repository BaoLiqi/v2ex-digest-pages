The staff who came up to me wanted to greet me, and I complained that I had just updated the system and the battery with 250 cycles had dropped from 100 to 99 and then to 98 today, with the entire cycle count increasing by no more than 10 times.\r\n\r\nThe staff said, oh, it has nothing to do with updating the system. According to our observation, using a phone case will reduce battery life."
