Family financial situation:\r\nI currently have over 200,000 in hand.\r\nThere are my parents, older brother, and younger sister at home, currently living in a dilapidated house.\r\nMy parents are older (in their 50s), and my dad doesn't want to work anymore because he says he's too old and can't do physical labor.\r\nMy older brother was born in 1995, is unmarried, and has no money.\r\n2. Dad's request:\r\nDad wants me to pay for building a house in our hometown.\r\nI don't want to pay for building a house; I want to buy an apartment in the city and am currently saving for a down payment.\r\nI believe that I will need a house, a car, and a bride price for marriage in the future, and I will have to bear these costs myself.\r\nMy parents cannot provide financial support and may ask me for money in the future.\r\n3. Concerns about building a house in our hometown:\r\nEven if a new house is built, it will most likely be given to my older brother.\r\nIf all my savings are spent on building a house in our hometown, my plan to buy a house in the city will be affected.\r\nI'm worried that even if the house in my hometown is built, my future spouse may not be satisfied, and I may still have to rely on buying a house in the city.\r\n4. Source of pressure:\r\nI feel a lot of pressure because I need to independently bear major expenses such as buying a house and getting married. My parents may also ask me for money to live on.\r\nActually, I'm a little reluctant to get married. I feel despair. Should I build a house in my hometown, or should I follow my own plan and buy an apartment in the city? I hope experienced people can give me some advice. Am I being selfish? I'm so sad to have to bear so many things. I was also stupid when I first graduated and bragged to my parents that my salary was over 10,000. I hope my mom can be happy, but my dad thinks I'm super amazing. But I'm just a beast of burden, constantly worrying about getting laid off."
