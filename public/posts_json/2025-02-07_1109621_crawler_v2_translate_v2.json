Any conflict arises from communication problems, and emotional stability is a guarantee of good communication. * Compatibility, 4 points. A large family gap will have the greatest impact, which is that it will produce different values, which will lead to large differences in the way of looking at things and dealing with things. This is also the main point of conflict. * Parents' satisfaction, 3 points. A marriage that parents don't approve of will inevitably have family conflicts. Two people must be of one mind and make great efforts to improve it. If one person does not actively improve the relationship, this conflict will be amplified. * Agreement on values, 3 points. It is unlikely that the three views are the same. The argument of agreement is more reasonable. It is allowed to have differences, but it is also important to respect each other's ideas. If two people have different perspectives on things, it is difficult to adapt to each other, and one party will inevitably give in, which will easily lead to conflicts over time. * Earning ability, 3 points. Poverty-stricken couples grieve over everything. * Appearance, 2 points. If you don’t like the appearance, you may get bored of looking at it. ps: Love is not included in the scoring, because love is an overall feeling of multiple combinations, and everyone's favorite points are different, so it is difficult to evaluate objectively."

Therefore, in summary, marriage is still about compatibility.

Love is the emotional foundation of marriage, which determines whether two people can be emotionally attracted to, understand and support each other. Marriage without affection easily lacks intimacy and happiness. Social status involves more realistic factors, such as family background, economic conditions, education level, etc. Similar family background and living habits help reduce marital friction and improve life stability. The ideal situation is to have both, an emotional foundation and a similar living background. If you have to choose, love is more important, because emotion is the core driving force of marriage, and social status can be adapted and adjusted through the efforts of both parties. Ultimately, marriage requires the joint efforts of both parties, and both emotional and realistic conditions need to be carefully considered."
