If you die, you have to build up your tools to increase damage and chop him down. Then you have more and more tools, more and more items, and you keep fighting stronger monsters in a repeating cycle. It's not as tiring as going to work or school. It's no different from traditional RPGs, but at least they have a storyline, like Witch Spring 4 (where the amount of plot is greater than the number of monsters, if you count the grass at the beginning of the building game as monsters). If the gameplay is about building, why not play LEGO (there's a game version too) instead of chopping grass? If the focus is on survival, there are so many horror games or shooting tactics games. In short, my feeling is that it's exhausting."
