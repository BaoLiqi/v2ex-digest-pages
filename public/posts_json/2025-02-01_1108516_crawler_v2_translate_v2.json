          "en": "It's good. Box office revenue is supported by visual spectacles and industrial blockbusters. Previously, domestic films relied on drama and comedy films to achieve a few small wins, resulting in all films being of this type. However, there isn't much difference between watching these films in the cinema and on TV, so there is no need to spend several times the cost to see them. This is also an important reason for the overall dismal domestic box office last year. If Nezha can achieve high box office during the Spring Festival, even Detective Chinatown or Creation of the Gods would be good. This way, the producers and investors can understand this problem and make films that are suitable for viewing on the big screen, instead of trying to educate the audience."
