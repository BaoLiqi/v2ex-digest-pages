(I've tried keyboards with other switches, and I've rejected them all.)\r\n\r\nThe advantages are: first, it's mini, with only 61 keys. Second, it's programmable, with cap+awsd programmed as arrow keys, so I can move the cursor with one hand when writing code.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages are that it doesn't have wireless, and the interface is the old-fashioned miniusb, which is really annoying.\r\n\r\nAlthough poker2 has been upgraded to typec, it doesn't have wireless. Poker pro has wireless, but it has cut off the programming function, and each generation is a little bit off. And the poker series has long been discontinued, and there will be no upgraded versions in the future.\r\n\r\nI've searched the internet, and there is no keyboard with 61 keys + programmable + wireless and wired dual modes, which is so frustrating.\r\n\r\nI wonder if anyone has any recommended keyboards"
