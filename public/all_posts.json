So basically exclude Jiang-flavored (of course, Yin Xi mentioned above can also be used as a daily drinking liquor, it's just a bit expensive, money is another story). Then go and choose other flavor types. Most people would choose light aroma, such as Huang Gai Bofen, which is a very good daily drinking liquor."
