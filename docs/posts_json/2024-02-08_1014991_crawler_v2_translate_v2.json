We are all workers, and it's not that we can't say if we earn a lot of money, we just don't want to answer, exposing our income situation. In most cases, we just brush it off. But I have met some good friends who will first reveal their income and then ask you. At this time, I feel like it's not right not to say, as not saying makes you seem insincere to him [crying with laughter], telling the truth goes against your wishes, and telling lies, you're not that kind of person. I'm curious how everyone deals with this?"
