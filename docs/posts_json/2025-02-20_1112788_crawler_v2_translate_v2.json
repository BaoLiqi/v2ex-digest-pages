First, this machine is considered a 16 series, so for some people, they buy new and not old, what they are buying is 16, although it is 16E, it is also a 16 series, satisfying the comparison mentality, many people don't buy mini, basically they all like big. Second, this pricing gives distributors a lot of room, and follows the national subsidy policy, from a risk perspective, it is very good."
