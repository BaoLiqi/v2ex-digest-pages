My family and I have been buying Sony phones since 2018, and I don't use anything, no screen protector or case, just completely bare; the other person uses both a screen protector and a silicone case. As a result, every one of my Sony phones is intact (XZ2 → Mark 3), and every one of hers has problems (XZ2 → Mark 2 → Mark 5; among them, the Mark 2 generation even had its screen replaced twice...). Moreover, it's just like OP described, no one provoked it, it just cracked itself. The key is that my hand trembles and twitches frequently, so I often drop things, and I don't know how many times the phone has been dropped. The sides of my XZ2 were chipped in the later stages, but the screen didn't crack. I've repeatedly advised her not to use that case, but she won't listen, and then it keeps cracking. So I advise OP to try not using a case or screen protector with your next phone to see if it lasts longer."

Silicone cases are generally very tightly fitted to the phone, and coupled with changes in the weather, indoor and outdoor environments, and the phone's own heat generation, which may cause the silicone case to expand and contract, perhaps the phone will always be subjected to some unbalanced force? Maybe it will crack one day.
