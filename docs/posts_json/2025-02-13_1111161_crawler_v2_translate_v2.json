          "en": "shift + crtl + enter automatically sent my reply saying, honestly, male best friends are the most unstable factor in a stable relationship. I wish you happiness and leave me with the last bit of dignity! After that, although I kept her on WeChat, I blocked her Moments. She didn't tell me she was getting married. During the Spring Festival in 2024, I suddenly remembered and looked at her Moments. The wedding photos were beautiful. Later, I saw her pregnancy diary and her baby's first birthday diary on her video account. My heart fluttered a bit, but there wasn't really any special feeling. From 2011 -> 2021, we knew each other for ten years. During that time, I had three girlfriends, and after breaking up, I would go to her harbor to confide. She would listen quietly and comfort me from time to time. She also dated a boyfriend in 2019. She accepted the guy's confession one night, but the next night she broke up because the guy got carried away and kissed her face (hugged her and kissed her face) and scared her. We agreed that if we were both still unmarried before the age of 30, we would just get together and live together, hahaha. Saying so much doesn't mean anything else. It's not to make OP understand my mood, nor to make OP feel like we have any resonance. People, adults, adult men, all have pressures from the economy and family. Look forward. Other people's lives are good, what does it have to do with you? Friends only need blessings. She deserves better, and you deserve better too."
