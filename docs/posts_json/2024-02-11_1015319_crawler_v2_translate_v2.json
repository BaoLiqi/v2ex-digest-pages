I know it exists, but I didn't know it would be so significant.\r\n\r\nThis morning, the second day of the Lunar New Year, according to the customs here, the household altar, the doorway, and the balcony all need incense and candles for worship. After I finished according to the instructions of the elders at home, I went back to my room. The room door was half-open, and the air purifier, which normally operates in automatic mode, suddenly went to maximum power, with a reading of 200+.\r\n\r\nI have already informed my family that burning incense indoors has a very negative impact on health, but my mother will only strongly ask my father to go to the balcony to close the door and smoke. She herself burns more than a dozen incense sticks every morning indoors and occasionally fumigates with mugwort at night.\r\n\r\nCommunicating with these older people is really tiring. They will only tell you, \"Incense smells fragrant, how can it be harmful to health? Mugwort is originally a medicine, and fumigating with mugwort is the wisdom of the ancients.\"\r\n\r\nI do not object to the religious beliefs of others at all, but you clearly know that it is only harmful and not beneficial to the health of your family, but you can't wake them up at all.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: The above text maintains a neutral stance on any religious and sacrificial activities.
