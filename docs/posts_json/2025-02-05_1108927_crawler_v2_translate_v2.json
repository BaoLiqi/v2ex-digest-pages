Fortunately, I don't use cash much anymore, otherwise the losses would have been severe.\r\n\r\nI plan to buy two cameras, one to install at home (with internet, rainproof). One outdoors (with electricity, but no internet, poor rain protection. I plan to use an old mobile phone to share a hotspot for the camera or buy one with its own data card). Are there any suitable camera recommendations? It's best to support NAS, otherwise, I'll be even angrier if the card is pulled out. Buying cloud storage seems quite expensive, thank you!\r\n\r\nHow are Hikvision and Xiaomi?"
