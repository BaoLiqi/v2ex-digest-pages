When cooking, I have to specifically put my face near the phone to make it work > FaceID will learn the appearance based on the recognition results (unlocking manually after recognition failure), thereby improving the recognition rate and speed. FaceID requires complete 3D information of the face. If too much of the face is covered, it will fail directly. If you frequently need to unlock with a partially covered face, it's recommended to record a mask ID, covering the parts below your nose. 2) It severely tests the way I hold my phone. My finger has to swipe up from the very bottom. I can't hold it from the top (why can't it be changed to the Android design where you can unlock it by swiping up from anywhere?) > Because this is Apple's global operating logic, that is, “any place with a ‘white bar’ can be dragged”. Furthermore, swiping your finger on the half screen will conflict with the side-swipe camera, up/down swipe to expand/collapse notifications. And this conflicting logic is because these operations are built on the basic logic of “white bar must be draggable”, rather than a peer-level logic conflict. 3) Since I have to swipe anyway, why don't I just use a fingerprint? I don't quite understand this swiping logic > If you are very fond of fingerprints, you can purchase iPhone 8 or iPhone SE models. iPhone needs to swipe again after unlocking because the display and mask logic of the notification center/lock screen are inconsistent with Android. Android has long lacked the logic of masking notifications on the lock screen (I know it exists now), so Apple needs to perform an additional layer of verification here in order to adopt this mask and unmask logic (unlocking the screen, but not entering the home screen), allowing you  to preview the masked notification content and home screen information, such as medication reminders, personal schedules, etc. – that's right, Apple believes that your medication data and what you need to do today also belong to the privacy that needs to be masked. And Android is usually a “screen on - unlock - enter the home screen” and one-time operation on fingerprint recognition models (or provides a separate skip unlock switch), so there is no such logic of “swiping”. the lock screen notification only has a previewing logic, not a mask/unmask logic. 4) I hope these are posted to encourage iPhone users to break out of their circle and see what's out there.... > Those who use iPhone do have Android phones, so what prompted Android users to switch to iPhone or use iPhone as their main phone? Have you ever thought about it? 5) It doesn't work when lying down, lying on your side, lying on your stomach, putting the phone flat on the table, or when you are sleepy > You can lie down if you expose a complete face with enough recognition range, including lying on your side. Lying on your stomach might be because the distance is too close. Face ID has a minimum recognition distance (about 10 cm), and being too close will cause the infrared light to not fully spread on the face, and the sampling information will be insufficient. Placing the phone flat on the table is possible, and it does not need to be placed upright. It can recognize at 360 degrees from various angles (only for iPhone 13 and newer models that support horizontal screen unlocking, and iOS 16 and above); being sleepy is because your eyes are not open wide enough, or your eyes are relatively small, and you have not obtained sufficient pupil information. A very important point of FaceID verification is to require you to open your eyes and look directly at the screen. The purpose is to resist unlocking attacks when the device owner is not in a voluntary state."
