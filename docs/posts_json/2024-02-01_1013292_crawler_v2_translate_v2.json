If you've done all of these, it normally wouldn't be like this. If it still is, it means it's caused by a physical problem, and you should go to the hospital for treatment."

Therefore, in recent years, I've changed to: washing my face normally before going to bed (but you can't just lie down to sleep after washing your face and applying moisturizer, there should be an interval, to allow the skin some time to secrete a small amount of oil (between the skin and the moisturizing lotion), this is very important for protecting the skin), and if there are no problems or important things in the morning, I only wash my face with water (this can actually wash away some of the outermost layer of oily dust).
