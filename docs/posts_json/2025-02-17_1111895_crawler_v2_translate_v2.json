Seeking guidance from experienced drivers.\r\n\r\nWill be using the car in Shanghai, with a daily commute of about 10KM. On weekends or short holidays, I might visit the surrounding areas or return to my hometown, which is about 400km one way.\r\n\r\nI plan to buy a car for family use. I'm open to both gasoline and electric cars, but I lean towards SUVs, as I feel they are more suitable for family use. However, I'm not entirely sure if an SUV is the best choice.\r\n\r\nI've previously looked at the Xiaomi SU7 and Tesla Model Y, but I've only ever driven two Toyota cars, a Corolla and a RAV4, both of which belong to my father. So, I know nothing about other cars and don't understand much. Please recommend some choices."
