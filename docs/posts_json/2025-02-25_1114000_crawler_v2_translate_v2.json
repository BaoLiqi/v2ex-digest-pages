These are not essential functions and may be better implemented as switches: 1. Expand the modifier when the cursor moves to the modifier: You can refer to the animation in the emacs plugin org-appear (https://github.com/awth13/org-appear) for the specific effect 2. Cloud synchronization: Or allow users to set webdav synchronization themselves 3. Comprehensive support for tables (preview, formatting, completion): I feel that large MD documents usually have a lot of tables. For the specific effect, you can refer to the vscode plugin markdowntable (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TakumiI.markdowntable), but I am not actually familiar with what WRIWS tables should look like. I have the impression that many editors will make a bunch of controls that are close to rich text in this area 4. vim like: Similar to ace editor and tiddlywiki's vim mode, only providing basic modal switching and key simulation, without supporting configuration."
