Last year, I commuted about 180 kilometers a day, mainly relying on assisted driving. I don't know if it can avoid road construction and cones. I always change lanes manually in advance. I dare not test it 😂. There is no problem with avoiding traffic jams and braking; it can stop. However, if I see a sudden brake from the car in front, I will manually intervene in advance. It definitely can't be compared to someone. Yu, the big mouth, said that he drove hundreds of kilometers from Anhui to Shenzhen without manual intervention. Also, don't have too many expectations for this self-driving at this stage; its reliability hasn't been fully verified. Don't be too aggressive. FSD has not entered China, and I personally will definitely not use domestic products that cannot be criticized and cannot have negative news. Or you can spend some money to rent a few cars to try."
