As for per capita, front-line workers at BYD are not even considered people, so don't talk about per capita. The low-price, involution route was their own choice, and the poor quality was their own making, so they can't blame others. As for over 90% of private enterprises, you better add some qualifiers. Large-scale, heavy asset industries don't primarily look at net profit margin. What about setting up factories in Europe and the United States? Don't even think about it. Not to mention human resources issues, these garbage companies like BYD have a bunch of problems with their assembly line factories, so it's not even about human resources issues."
