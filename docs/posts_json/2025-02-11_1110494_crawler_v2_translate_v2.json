Since he used to drive a 2011 POLO, he still wants to look at Volkswagen's SUVs for his next car. He himself likes the FAW-Volkswagen Tange, but this car is about to be replaced, so I arranged to look at the SAIC-Volkswagen Tiguan L. The interior and exterior are really old-fashioned, and there is no qualitative leap compared to the POLO."
