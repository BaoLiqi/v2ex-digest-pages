The commute distance is 10 kilometers.\nI am currently considering the following two options:\n\nDecathlon RC100:\nPros: Simple and elegant appearance, relatively affordable price (about 1799 yuan), suitable for beginners.\nCons: There is no Decathlon store locally, and I am worried about maintenance and debugging issues.\n\nXidesheng AD350:\nPros: Stylish design, promotional price of about 3200 yuan, the budget is barely acceptable.\nCons: I've seen online that it's a popular model, and people say Xidesheng is a pain to repair. Is it really that bad?\n\nConsidering my specific situation - there are Giant and Xidesheng stores around my residence, but no Decathlon store - I would like to get your opinions, especially from those with similar experiences or in-depth knowledge of these two brands. Please tell me:\n\nGiven my limited budget, which option do you think is more suitable for me, or do you have better recommendations? Thanks 🙏"
