The four pairs of wires inside the network cable are arranged clockwise in sequence, so it's easiest to crimp the crystal head with the B type wire sequence. For cables like Cat6a, you can only crimp with the b type wire sequence if you want to do it correctly, I have tried a type and it's almost impossible. The actual measurement shows that swapping the positions of the four pairs of colors 12, 36, 45, and 78, swapping the positions of two wires of the same color, does not affect the use at all, does not affect the network speed, and there is no additional interference, so there is no need to recrimp. If they are not swapped in pairs and the different colors are mixed up, it will seriously affect the network speed."
