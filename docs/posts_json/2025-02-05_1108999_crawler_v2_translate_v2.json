I'm thinking about buying a house.\r\nMy partner (born in '94) and I (born in '95) are both currently in Shanghai. Both are in the Internet industry. I am a developer and she does data analysis.\r\nWe are planning to have a baby this year.\r\n\r\n* Neither of us wants to be wage slaves in Shanghai paying high mortgages. We both want to go to Hangzhou (I am from Zhejiang, and her siblings and mother are all in Hangzhou).\r\n* Our combined annual salary is about 1.3 million yuan.\r\nWe initially drifted in Beijing and then Shanghai. We really want a home to decorate nicely and live a peaceful life.\r\n* We received 220,000 yuan in betrothal money, and my partner said she would use it to buy a house. There will be no further support from her family. So, including the betrothal money and our savings and housing fund, we can take out 3.3 million yuan in one go.\r\n\r\nBut I don't want to throw all the money in at once. I might want to keep 1 million yuan in cash, which leaves 2.3 million yuan for the down payment. We'll take out a loan and slowly pay it off with the housing fund.\r\nConsidering that we don't want to upgrade later, we want to buy a house worth about 4 million yuan in one step.\r\nI just started having this idea and don't know much about the real estate market.\r\n\r\nI have a few questions to ask you guys:\r\n* 1. Since we are both in the Internet industry, if we switch jobs to Hangzhou, we will probably look for Internet-related jobs. Which area is better to live in (currently preparing to look at Binjiang)?\r\n* 2. Is now a good time to buy?\r\n* 3. What issues do you mainly focus on when you guys buy houses?

I see that the biggest controversy in the front is that two or three people said not to choose Future Sci-Tech City, let me talk about it first: Yuhang Future Sci-Tech City: 1. It is currently at a historical low price and has an upward trend. 2. Choose the \"Three Brothers\" or nearby properties in Future Sci-Tech City, which is the central axis of government development. Other locations really don't need to be considered. 3. Because that area is building a stadium, cultural center, central park, and MIXC, all of which will be completed in 2027. The price will definitely be higher than now at that time. 4. There are many Internet companies, and if the situation is not good, you can take the high-speed rail from the West Railway Station to work in Shanghai, which is very convenient. Binjiang: 1. Many companies. 2. It is also a district that the government is vigorously developing. 3. Housing prices are resistant, but slightly higher than Future Sci-Tech City because it has complete facilities such as the Asian Games and the Olympic Sports Center. 4. Close to West Lake and Qiantang River. These two districts have many companies, many programmers, and high mobility, so you don't have to worry about selling them in the future. You really need to be cautious about other districts. You don't need to consider Xihu District, Shenhua, or Gongshu. There are many old and small houses, and the prices of new houses are also high. I will laugh at the claim that the prices of second-hand houses are resistant to falls. Buying second-hand houses in those districts is for those rich people to take over."

          "en": "@5200 #1 I feel that everyone is being misled by the annual salary. Or they're thinking a little too simply. It's not like you can just buy whatever you want after earning a certain annual salary. First of all, if our annual salary can be stable and sustainable, then of course we can buy whatever we want. But we are proletarians and do not control the means of production. Moreover, we are in the Internet industry, which has a high turnover rate. If we lose our jobs, our income will immediately drop to zero. Everyone understands the current employment environment. It's really not easy to find a job after being unemployed. Therefore, we need to deal with unemployment and ensure our ability to resist risks. Many unfortunate marriages or lives online, the so-called middle-class decline, are due to underestimating their own ability to resist risks. The 4 million yuan also takes into account that we can pay the full amount in nearly a year if we don't lose our jobs in 2025, so we don't have to worry about losing our jobs later. Try not to force yourself and be more calm. Secondly, there will be many places to spend money in the future, such as getting married, buying a car, raising children, renovating, and maybe even leaving some money for the children. Secondly, buying a house is a very cautious matter. If you are not careful, you may lose hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan. I have also seen some discussions about \"essential needs,\" but I don't think it's right. Whether it's an essential need or not, you must maintain a cautious attitude. \"Essential need\" is just a word to comfort yourself. We can't consider the next 30 years. But we need to choose the optimal solution right now."

Another one is a client I used to work with who switched cities within the operator and moved from Jinan to Hangzhou. He bought a house in Binjiang District.\r\nFrom my personal point of view, I think it is currently a good time to buy in Hangzhou. Hangzhou has many plans, but whether they can be realized is a problem. Those who want to make money have already run away. Those who react slowly want to find someone to take over at a high price. Investments in some areas will be adjusted. Rich people will buy better areas. Affordable housing will make the prices of houses for essential needs uncomfortable. There is still hope that houses for essential needs close to the subway will stabilize, but the prices of houses for essential needs in other places depend on fate. The core areas will always be the core areas and will not transfer their identity because other areas have a few more industries.\r\nThere are many things to pay attention to when looking at a house, such as whether it is a new or second-hand house. I can't finish talking about it. The differences in personal situations cannot be used as a reference. For example, my parents' house has a top school district, and I don't need to look at the school district for the house I bought myself.

Do you want a school registration in the main urban area? If you want to lie flat, you won't upgrade later, right?
