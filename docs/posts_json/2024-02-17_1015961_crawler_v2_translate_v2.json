The job content is to do some testing work, including debugging the operating status of the router testing system, etc. The development work is relatively simple. According to the principle of job change and salary change, the base salary remains unchanged, but the bonus needs to be re-determined. And this is not a business trip, it's working there, and the problem of meals and accommodation needs to be solved by oneself. The travel expenses caused by customer needs can go through the reimbursement process.\r\n\r\nLet's talk about your views on the “employee graveyard“!"

After the job transfer, two situations can occur: (1) Not providing working conditions; (2) Reducing salary and benefits.\r\nFourth: 🔸Please raise objections to the above two situations <Objection Letter to Working Conditions/Salary>. It is still necessary to reply through the following methods: EMS express, company email, OA system, or DingTalk, as well as video recordings delivered to the human resources or legal representative (Note: each method needs to be taken).
