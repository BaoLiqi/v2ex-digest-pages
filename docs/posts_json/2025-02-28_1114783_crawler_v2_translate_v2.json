The expectations are set very high, and the final price is 530,000 yuan, which makes me feel that 500,000 yuan is quite cheap. I was sitting on the subway, and I was about to fall asleep watching the press conference. When this price came out, it perked me up. An older guy who was also watching exclaimed, 'Damn!' The difference between 800,000 yuan and 500,000 is still huge. Some people who caught the opportunities of the times might think it's expensive to spend 800,000 yuan on a car, but many people can grit their teeth and buy the 56E for 500,000 yuan. Although the 56E doesn't cost 500,000 yuan in these two years, I was blown awake by the cold wind on the way home from the subway. 500,000 is still too much for me. I just paid off the mortgage last year, and I'll have to take out a loan again for this car. The days of paying off the loan are still too torturous. Parking in Shenzhen is also expensive. Spending on parking fees at the company and the community every day is not as good as taking the business class on the subway every day right now. Let's see if the YU7 in a few months can make me pay."
