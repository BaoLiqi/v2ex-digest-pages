SFTP 连接不稳定重新连接后只能自动返回 home 目录，不能自动返回断开前的目录\r\n5. 因为同时不支持拖拽下载文件且没有保存文件按钮，MAC 商店版完全不支持下载文件到本地\r\n6. 主机延迟高或是带宽占满时有一个 100%复现的严重 Bug ，切换到一个文件多的目录再切换到一个文件少的目录，文件列表显示的 100%是文件多的目录，显示的路径又是文件少的那个目录，如果你尝试重命名或下载这个目录里的文件就会报错文件不存在。",
          "en": "Then I discovered a bunch of features that are even worse than open-source SSH software:\r\n\r\n1.  The desktop version **must** register and log in to their account before connecting to its own host.\r\n2.  SFTP doesn't even support drag-and-drop file downloads, which most open-source SSH clients support, nor does it support breakpoint resume.\r\n3.  More importantly, there is no save button, you can only copy files to the host on the left.\r\n4.  SFTP connection is unstable. After reconnecting, it can only automatically return to the home directory, and cannot automatically return to the directory before disconnection.\r\n5.  Because it does not support drag-and-drop file downloads and has no save file button, the MAC store version does not support downloading files to the local machine at all.\r\n6.  When the host latency is high or the bandwidth is full, there is a serious bug that can be reproduced 100%. Switching to a directory with many files and then switching to a directory with few files, the file list displayed is 100% the directory with many files, and the displayed path is the directory with few files. If you try to rename or download a file in this directory, it will report an error that the file does not exist."
