          "en": "Hello V friends, OP is currently at level 1.5 (likely referring to experience). If any V friends remember OP, they should remember that I previously posted a thread asking for your advice on how to get into a big company. Fortunately, I was lucky and after countless interviews over half a year, I finally landed a full-time offer from a big company.\r\nNow the reality is:\r\nOP is from Hubei, 24 years old.\r\nI previously had two jobs, both outsourced development positions at big companies. I am currently in Shenzhen, and my family situation is very ordinary, unable to support buying a house. Although my family gives me a lot of freedom and accepts that I can settle down in other cities and don't require me to go back to Hubei, as a young man from the countryside, I still really want to buy a house and put down roots in a big city (second-tier, not considering Beijing, Shanghai, or Shenzhen).\r\nConflicts:\r\n1. This offer requires a change of base location, either Beijing or Hangzhou. I personally prefer Hangzhou, mainly because I feel the housing prices are more affordable, and after struggling in Shenzhen, this 'dry battery city' for almost two years, I feel that first-tier cities are not suitable for me. Hangzhou's pace might be slightly slower.\r\n2. My girlfriend of one year is in a certain central enterprise in Shenzhen and cannot easily change her base. She is older than me, has worked in Shenzhen for four years. Although the salary of central enterprises is generally average, the benefits are good, and she can save a little money, but not much. So I am also reluctant to let her give up everything and go with me. Her suggestion is for me to go and take the job, stabilize my work first, be in a long-distance relationship for 1-2 years, and then she can come and join me. But I have already adapted to the rhythm of having her in my life, and it would be a big gap in my life to go to another city without her. Currently, both families are also aware of our relationship, and I personally am developing the relationship towards marriage, so I don't have those 'scumbag' thoughts.\r\nAlas, I am very conflicted and also very uncomfortable now. I ask all the older brothers and sisters to give me some advice."

          "en": "First, you should go to the big company for two years, and it will be much easier to go to other big companies you want to go to after you leave. Second, your girlfriend's parents are afraid that their daughter will have a hard time in a first-tier city and want her to return to her hometown in the north. That is to say, the possibility of her settling down in Shenzhen is actually not very high, so she might give up her job in the central enterprise later on. Considering the above two points, what you should do now is: 1. Go to Hangzhou, 2. Stabilize your girlfriend, don't let the long-distance relationship ruin things, 3. After working for two years, you two can consider together where to settle down (you have to face the problem of not being able to adapt to life without your girlfriend, there's no way out). Finally, to add one point, your personal future is the most important thing. If you don't have a good future, you won't be able to keep the person you want. Between staying in Shenzhen and not being able to afford a house, losing your girlfriend, and going to Hangzhou and having a long-distance relationship and losing your girlfriend, in these two worst-case scenarios, at least you have a future to strive for if you go to Hangzhou."

Big companies are not that big of a deal. You are likely to be in a non-core business line, and the job content may have some gaps with your imagination. 2. In terms of relationships, I think one important point is that both parties should not hinder each other's progress for the sake of the relationship. For example, if you break up later, the OP will definitely think, 'If I had gone to XX back then, it would have been so good'. If the woman had such an opportunity to go to Beijing or Hangzhou, I have the same attitude. 3. Going to Beijing or Hangzhou is not as big a deal as you think. Considering the future is a bit far off; it's not like you will be working there for the rest of your life. If the two of you stay together, I think the most likely scenario is that you stay in Hangzhou for 2 years, your resume is good enough, and you jump back to Shenzhen.
