Testosterone and androstenedione are catalyzed by 5α-reductase into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which, after binding to the androgen receptor on hair follicle cells, can miniaturize hair follicles. Male AGA (Male Androgenetic Alopecia, MAGA) is an androgen-dependent disease. Although the mode of inheritance is uncertain, obvious genetic susceptibility has been observed. Tosti et al. observed 20 patients with pre-pubertal AGA, and found that they all had a significant family history of AGA, while in female AGA (Female Androgenetic Alopecia, FAGA), the role of androgens is uncertain, with only 1/3 of FAGA women showing abnormal androgen levels. The probability of male hair loss is higher than that of the control group in the first-degree relatives of female hair loss patients, indicating that AGA has a common genetic tendency. Additionally, chronic scalp inflammation, oxidative stress, and inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway are also involved in the pathogenesis of AGA.\\" I have also followed this issue, and the conclusion given by most scholars is that methods to promote blood circulation are all useful. Therefore: 1. Combing and massaging the scalp skin is useful, but the force and method should be considered to prevent damage to hair follicles during the process. 2. Methods that stimulate the skin to achieve capillary dilation and activity, such as ginger, are useful, but prevent scalp skin sensitivity and allergies. 3. Minoxidil is useful, but it is often an alcohol solvent and can easily cause allergies. 4. Finasteride and dutasteride can inhibit 5α-reductase, thereby reducing serum DHT levels and inhibiting hair follicle miniaturization. However, one needs to assess whether the side effects of the medication affect their life. No matter how you want to treat it, I recommend that you go to a Class III hospital and seek a doctor to diagnose and treat it with the doctor's treatment plan, do not blindly look for various folk remedies; thank you."}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"植发吧","en":"Get a hair transplant."}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"靈魂之子，澆給。","en":"Soul child, water it."}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"要是我秃了就直接光头了，头发对我帅气的容颜影响不大。","en":"If I go bald, I'll just shave my head, hair doesn't have much effect on my handsome face."}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"@Rache1 这个真没忍住，还我功德。","en":"@Rache1 I really couldn't resist this, give me back my merits."}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"可以问问孙亚龙，他经验丰富","en":"You can ask Sun Ya-long, he has a lot of experience."}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"脱发和阳痿,男人最信玄学的时候","en":"Hair loss and impotence, when men believe in metaphysics the most."}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"凭什么生姜有用，而大蒜五香八角桂皮香叶茴香不行","en":"Why is ginger useful, but not garlic, five-spice powder, star anise, cinnamon bark, bay leaf, or fennel?"}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"别瞎想了","en":"Don't think nonsense."}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"????"},{"en":"????"}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"小心把头皮辣坏了","en":"Be careful not to burn your scalp with the heat."}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"想想吧，如果土方法有用，这世界上还有秃子吗，一切都是徒劳的","en":"Think about it, if folk remedies were useful, would there still be bald people in this world?

From a big picture perspective, it's best for me if VSCode has a decent competitor, but it doesn't matter if it doesn't, so I don't expect it to replace VSCode. And in reality, there are indeed some defects with Zed currently, such as the fact that it only supports Mac for the time being, and another is that it made me cringe the first time I opened it - software that only targets Mac, and all the text on the UI is actually monospaced! (Although it may not actually be strictly monospaced, there is a saying, “quasi-proportional spacing to allow the font to still feel monospace” - in short, the design intention is still monospaced). You say this aesthetic is made by the people from Atom, it really feels like a joke. The official website is even funnier, using different fonts for different pictures. As for completely replacing VSCode for me, I think various functions are secondary, after all, 80% of people will only use 20% of the functions. In addition to improving the support for major platforms, the following points are very important: # Remote Development or support for Web so that you can use a remote editor in a browser like code-server to support development on the server. These are all in the roadmap, and it will pass if it is done. Of course, there are some subtle differences, such as things like Remote Development or Collaboration, to achieve the best experience, it is best to consider it when designing the underlying architecture of the editor, so it must be a very large thing when it is done, and it cannot be made into a separate plugin. For example, VSCode separately separated an extension host process and then defined a set of RPC protocols. According to the author of the vscode-remote-oss project, the Remote plugin provided by the VSCode official only provides the integration that connects this architecture through SSH (so TA built one himself). Although you may not use Remote, the architecture is still running on the local side, and all operations have to go through RPC. Even the Vim mode function has this kind of problem (one of the top three Issues voted on in VSCode GitHub is about the native Vim mode). Another advantage of VSCode in this regard is that it is written with Web, so it can run directly on the browser, and I have never seen one trying to do DirectUI in the browser that can maintain a certain complexity and at the same time achieve a particularly good experience. # Plugin ecosystem Not only the commonly used plugins, but I also rely more on some long-tail plugins. For example, ccls replaces the official C++ plugin, Codeium replaces Copilot, and OCaml Platform is these niche standard plugins. Although I try to install as few plugins as possible, the above are still key dependencies. These are actually not related to MSFT itself, they are all community-developed. Now when everyone makes a tool, they generally consider at least Vim, VSCode, and Emacs editors. Then there are NeoVim, Sublime, as well as the JetBrains, VS, and Eclipse trio. It is considered a success if a new player can squeeze into the second tier. VSCode has a natural advantage in that it has grown and established a good symbiotic relationship with TypeScript. VSCode is written in TypeScript, and VSCode at the same time provides a good editing experience for TypeScript, and because of the good editing experience provided by VSCode, TypeScript is also easier to promote. Similar models actually appear not only in VSCode, for example, at least before VSCode became popular, some niche language plugins on Emacs could provide a better experience than other editors, such as org is naturally bound, as well as proof-general, merlin, etc., and of course, there are various LISP. One advantage of playing this way is that although people in other languages may not use you, you have a firm grip on the group of this specific language and have a stable base. Zed is not unable to take this road, such as trying to become the de facto development environment for Rust, but it is too difficult in all aspects compared to the precedents of VSCode and TS. # Commercialization plan The essential difference between Zed and new editors that appeared before on the Rust front such as lapce, xi (helix is difficult to compare, because there doesn't seem to be a usable GUI front end), I think, is that Zed was built as a commercial project from the beginning. I started paying attention to the Zed project around mid-January, and I saw their articles on GPU, and then I looked at the editor. I thought it was good at the time but not very interested, because it was not open source, and I would not associate the critical path in my workflow with something that is incomplete and closed source. I didn't expect it to be open-sourced after a week. It seems that the official meaning is that the editor is open source (copyleft GPL/AGPL to prevent others from using it directly, and the CLA requires all copyrights to go to Zed company so that they can use it themselves), and then sell services. There are two problems here, the first is whether this business model is sustainable, such as how much actual demand there is for the only promising Zed Channels (if the Zed itself is well done, we can consider emotional support, but this kind of support cannot cure the fundamental problems of the business model). I actually don't care if Zed Industries can survive, because even if they die, an open-source project can still be given to the community to continue, but if it dies too early, the project is not well-completed and the ecosystem is too poor, then the result is estimated to be worse than Atom.

Article 38 of the 'Labor Law' stipulates: 'Employers shall ensure that workers rest at least one day a week.' The working hour system of 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week is called the standard working system, corresponding to the two-day weekend system implemented by most units, with 8 hours of work per day and 5 days of work and 2 days of rest per week. For some units that can only arrange for employees to rest for one day a week due to work requirements, it is necessary to shorten the daily working hours so that the total working hours of 6 days a week do not exceed 40 hours.   If the working hours exceed 40 hours per week, the excess portion is overtime, and the employer needs to pay overtime pay to the workers in accordance with the laws and regulations.\\" One day off a week is illegal, unless overtime pay is given. First, the job market is not good, and second, many people default that one day off a week is acceptable.

The cloud EBS has several characteristics, such as high performance, three replicas, IO burst, attach, detach, etc. These characteristics depend on hardware investment, such as high-performance network RDMA, which may not be available in a self-built IDC. Therefore, there are some differences between k8s under a self-built IDC and on the cloud, and the difficulty and challenge will be greater. On the cloud, cloud vendors provide cloud instances of stateful services, and the backend has turned to k8s, this direction has occurred, and there is not much controversy. Self-built IDC scenarios have higher difficulty, but TiDB also provides a solution for IDC scenarios TiDB Operator, which relies on local disk LPV, rather than remote storage. LPV is volatile, and TiKV has built-in three-replica features, which just make up for this shortcoming. Similar to this is Kafka's multi-replica mechanism. But for other basic services that do not have three replicas, it is not so easy to enter k8s, and they must face a dilemma: local disks need to solve the multi-replica problem by themselves; remote disks have low performance and will have a large performance loss.

Hardware: 1. The display supports Dolby Vision. Because Dolby Vision is private certification and authorization for hardware, only displays certified by Dolby can use the private Dolby dynamic metadata in video files to complete dynamic mapping of brightness and color; the display is best with a global maximum brightness of 1000 nits, otherwise the HDR display effect will be robbing Peter to pay Paul. 2. The decoder supports HDR HEVC video decoding, preferably hardware decoding. Software decoding is also feasible, but the CPU requirements for software decoding of 4K or higher HEVC HDR are relatively high. However, as mentioned in the following text, the reality is that only the system player supports Dolby Vision well, and the system player will not use third-party software decoding, so software decoding is meaningless here. Software: 1. The operating system supports HDR and Dolby Vision. The reason is that the dynamic metadata values in video files are private, and the corresponding private dynamic metadata needs to be transmitted to the display when the video frames are displayed. The display needs this data to perform dynamic mapping of brightness and color. Current situation: Windows 11 supports it; you need to go to the settings to enable HDR for the corresponding display and select Dolby Vision mode; macOS basically supports it with Apple's own screens (laptops built-in screens, iMac displays, XDisplay Pro). Some older models may not be supported. Some MacBook Airs have a global maximum brightness of only 500 nits, resulting in a discounted effect. Dolby on the built-in screen does not need to be turned on manually. 2. The player supports Dolby Vision because it involves the transmission of dynamic metadata to the display, and the operating system's display window needs to support an interface for applications to send Dolby dynamic metadata when rendering video frames. macOS has a specific UI layer support; Windows doesn't seem to have one (not sure). Current situation: Currently, it seems that there are no third-party players that have fully supported Dolby in the above methods, and the best may be for Dolby for HLG, discarding the dynamic metadata and playing it as an HDR video in the ordinary static metadata HLG format. The most perfect support is still the system player, Windows 11 \\"Movies & TV\\" (HEVC extension needs to be installed first).

There is basic Dolby Vision support at the Android system level, provided that the hardware manufacturer's display devices and hardware decoders also support it. Therefore, TVs that explicitly support Dolby Vision (some Sony and HTC models) are OK. But when using it, pay attention to whether the TV display mode will be correctly switched to Dolby Vision mode by the app (possibly the Sony display's correction mode). At the software level, streaming platforms Netflix and Tencent Video have no issues. I haven't learned about third-party apps playing their own content. 3.

It's hard to say whether I will need to settle down there in the future), and there is less legal risk (small-property-rights houses are unlikely to be compensated to the buyer in case of demolition), (the current average price is 6000-10000, but I can only accept below 8000, my ability is limited, and I am bearish on these small cities);\\n\\nSo the total budget is 50-120 (small-property-rights houses can be paid in full, large-property-rights houses need to consider installments and mortgages, and under the current interest rate decline, buying it should still be a negative asset), only the unfinished building, and the decoration has to be calculated separately, and it may need to be decorated a little bit.\\n\\nNow I live in my grandfather's old house (Lao Cuo) in a small rural area below, and a family of 7 can only be said to be able to live there, so it's a necessity. After buying a new house, the whole family can live there (2+2+2+1), which is exactly four rooms. In addition, in the city area, my parents can also choose to change factories and work, and the commute will be closer and they will walk less (of course, I sincerely hope that my parents can work less and rest more, and health is important).\\n\\nFour first-tier city workers (including me) are all working outside, and one is still studying. In terms of funding, I should contribute 95%, or maybe all of it. My parents earn less working, plus they paid for their children to study before, and they have saved less. The others haven't been out for long, and they have saved less. I've been out for 4 years, and I'm a programmer, so I earn more.\\n\\nAbout myself:\\n\\nThe eldest son in the family, an ordinary programmer, has been working in Shenzhen for 4 years. My savings are mainly my salary. In terms of investment and financial management, I have lost 3W in A-shares (including stock funds), and the rest is mainly in bonds and monetary funds. I am still a financial novice. I really want to stay in the big city, but the first-tier house prices are really difficult for a worker like me.\\n\\nI am still single, and I don't have a partner. I am actually quite conflicted about this house, because it basically drains my savings, but I only come back to live during the Spring Festival, and it is uncertain where I will be in the future. Buying this house has an element of taking care of my parents' face.\\n\\nFor personal future planning, I am now quite confused. When I graduated, I just started working in a medium-sized factory. I could do test questions and brush eight-part essays after work every day, thinking about entering a big factory in the future. Later, I encountered the contraction and layoffs of big factories, and I couldn't even submit my resume. Later, I went to a foreign company, and the market contracted soon after, and the entire department was shut down. Later, I interviewed at Alibaba, but the HR interview failed. I was quite disheartened about the future. Now I am working in a small company, and I am constantly learning English, but it seems that I don't have a particularly strong motivation to go out. Maybe I will try remote work when I go back to my hometown (uncertain). Occasionally, I think about changing careers to do business, but I have no experience and no idea.\\n\\nSome questions/help:\\n\\nAt present, when the stock market, housing market, and population are declining, it's somewhat like Japan's debt recession. Is it appropriate to buy a house at this point? Is it better to buy small-property-rights or large-property-rights houses?

It's been the eighth year, 855, over 100,000 a year. The work pressure is not high, but there is basically no hope of promotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, I can keep going, but in recent years, the company's product competitiveness has been getting lower and lower (more and more domestic competitors). In addition, the general environment is not good, and the company is obviously going downhill.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wanted to change jobs since the end of last year. Because I work in a joint venture, I have interacted with colleagues from foreign companies a lot, and I can no longer accept the working atmosphere of private companies. I only want to find a foreign company. But in a fifth-tier city, there are not many companies to begin with, let alone foreign companies. If I want to find one, I can only go to a nearby city.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Chinese New Year this year, I visited relatives. My wife's cousin is a small sales leader in a foreign company in Wuxi, which is a Fortune 500 manufacturing company. I saw that the company happened to be recruiting a position similar to my major, and the salary might be 20,000 to 30,000 more than mine now. He said that he could help me if I wanted to go. Let me consider it and give him an answer after the New Year.\\r\\n\\r\\nProblems faced:\\r\\nThe biggest problem is that my wife is in a local government public institution. Even if I buy a house in Wuxi in the future, it is unlikely that she will give up her public institution to come over. In this way, I can only go home every weekend, and it takes an hour and a half to get home by highway. If the rent and commuting expenses are deducted, it is equivalent to no increase in income. And there are no children yet, and long-term separation will be a big problem for children's education.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy concerns are that I am already 30 years old, and it will only become more and more difficult to change jobs in the future. Now there is a suitable and good opportunity in a foreign company, which will definitely help my personal development. Moreover, the products of my current company are very niche, and most of the knowledge accumulated in the past is industry-specific. If I want to switch to other industries after the company fails, it will be very difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy wife suggests that I go. She thinks that as long as the salary is high, it doesn't matter if we live apart. My parents don't recommend me to go. They just want me to live a quiet life here..."}],"type":"content"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"你老婆认为只要工资高，分居无所谓。。。听着味儿不对。","en":"Your wife thinks that as long as the salary is high, it doesn't matter if you live apart...

It basically doesn't work when lying on my side, or when I'm sleepy in the morning, or when I'm lying on a pillow. When cooking, I have to specifically put my face near the phone to make it work > FaceID will learn the appearance based on the recognition results (unlocking manually after recognition failure), thereby improving the recognition rate and speed. FaceID requires complete 3D information of the face. If too much of the face is covered, it will fail directly. If you frequently need to unlock with a partially covered face, it's recommended to record a mask ID, covering the parts below your nose. 2) It severely tests the way I hold my phone. My finger has to swipe up from the very bottom. I can't hold it from the top (why can't it be changed to the Android design where you can unlock it by swiping up from anywhere?) > Because this is Apple's global operating logic, that is, “any place with a ‘white bar’ can be dragged”. Furthermore, swiping your finger on the half screen will conflict with the side-swipe camera, up/down swipe to expand/collapse notifications. And this conflicting logic is because these operations are built on the basic logic of “white bar must be draggable”, rather than a peer-level logic conflict. 3) Since I have to swipe anyway, why don't I just use a fingerprint? I don't quite understand this swiping logic > If you are very fond of fingerprints, you can purchase iPhone 8 or iPhone SE models. iPhone needs to swipe again after unlocking because the display and mask logic of the notification center/lock screen are inconsistent with Android. Android has long lacked the logic of masking notifications on the lock screen (I know it exists now), so Apple needs to perform an additional layer of verification here in order to adopt this mask and unmask logic (unlocking the screen, but not entering the home screen), allowing you  to preview the masked notification content and home screen information, such as medication reminders, personal schedules, etc. – that's right, Apple believes that your medication data and what you need to do today also belong to the privacy that needs to be masked. And Android is usually a “screen on - unlock - enter the home screen” and one-time operation on fingerprint recognition models (or provides a separate skip unlock switch), so there is no such logic of “swiping”. the lock screen notification only has a previewing logic, not a mask/unmask logic. 4) I hope these are posted to encourage iPhone users to break out of their circle and see what's out there.... > Those who use iPhone do have Android phones, so what prompted Android users to switch to iPhone or use iPhone as their main phone? Have you ever thought about it? 5) It doesn't work when lying down, lying on your side, lying on your stomach, putting the phone flat on the table, or when you are sleepy > You can lie down if you expose a complete face with enough recognition range, including lying on your side. Lying on your stomach might be because the distance is too close. Face ID has a minimum recognition distance (about 10 cm), and being too close will cause the infrared light to not fully spread on the face, and the sampling information will be insufficient. Placing the phone flat on the table is possible, and it does not need to be placed upright. It can recognize at 360 degrees from various angles (only for iPhone 13 and newer models that support horizontal screen unlocking, and iOS 16 and above); being sleepy is because your eyes are not open wide enough, or your eyes are relatively small, and you have not obtained sufficient pupil information. A very important point of FaceID verification is to require you to open your eyes and look directly at the screen. The purpose is to resist unlocking attacks when the device owner is not in a voluntary state."}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"@CivAx #72 你说得对那为什么我在 iOS 上一个软件就能解决的问题我要用安卓要换这么多软件？而且我也试过安卓的面具刷模块，过了折腾的年纪了。我记得还要去酷安上找对应的版本，刷的过程也很麻烦。还有定时跑任务签到怎么没说呢？","en":"@CivAx #72 You are right.

Your hard work is far less important than a promotion from your relative. - Most importantly, in most companies, working hard and diligently is useless. The company's distribution model is a pyramid. The bottom-level components are highly replaceable, and the middle and upper levels are also replaceable. The reason why middle and upper levels are not easily replaced is mainly due to the high cost of trust, and also because of their large responsibilities, rather than the replaceability of their job skills. If we assume that everyone is trustworthy, the cost of trust is almost zero. In fact, the job skills of a CTO and a technical manager in a company are far more replaceable than those of an ordinary coder. The factors that determine your income are never what you do, but the level of the pyramid you are on.

The iPhone's HDR is not tuned at all. It's fake, and it only makes you feel amazing when you see it for the first time, but it's tiring to look at it for a long time. The highlights or the daytime sunlight at night are almost overflowing, although HDR makes the bright areas brighter and the dark areas darker, but it needs to be based on real vision, not just to make the bright areas brighter and the dark areas darker. At least the highlights compared to what the human eye sees are fake. The HDR compared to cameras is very real, the highlights will be brighter, but not just stupidly bright, which is more in line with what the human eye sees. 2. Live Photos, a difficult function, started to use it at first, but later found that the videos taken for at least half the time are blurred segments when waving the phone. Maybe I'm just not used to taking a photo and having to stay still for a while. 3. Don't boast about the white balance, the iPhone's white balance has always been green. Even in the same scene, shooting a few more photos will give you a different kind of green. I really don't know how to think that his white balance is good. And it can't even be manually adjusted before shooting. 4. Outrageous sharpening. There is no need to say more about this point, it is really outrageous sharpening. The built-in camera can't be turned off. It's really outrageous. The photos can only be viewed on the small screen of the iPhone, and you can see the sharpening smear without zooming in on the computer.

To maintain their status as a recent graduate, they couldn't pay social security (meaning they couldn't sign an employment contract, only intern), and then they might have taken the exam a few times, but they never passed. Then, they just gave up and stayed at home.\\n\\nBefore the Spring Festival, there was a big argument with the child. The parents meant that the child stayed home all day without looking for a job, living off savings, and probably wanted to stimulate the child. They said some harsh words, saying that if the child didn't look for a job, they would change the locks and not let them come back. This hurt the child's self-esteem.\\n\\nNow they bring this matter up with me, and I want to help, but it seems difficult to know where to start. The main problems are:\\n\\n- I don't know what kind of job is suitable for [International Trade] (GPT recommends “trade specialists in import and export companies, supply chain management positions in large multinational companies, or consulting consultants in trade consulting companies”, I don't know if anyone knows).\\n\\n- After being graduated for so long, they shouldn't have the status of a recent graduate. Without work experience, how can they find a job that matches their major through social recruitment?\\n\\n- It's not like before. You can just say hello and find a job through connections. Now, big companies have to go through formal interview processes. Even if you have connections, you must meet the minimum education and experience requirements. Directly arranging a job should be impossible. I don't think the chances are high even if I find someone to recommend them internally to a big company.\\n\\n- Although my friend's child has never worked, they have interned, such as at Alibaba, but they said they didn't like it (it seemed like they felt their personality wasn't suitable). I feel like my friend's child may not be able to endure hardship, and is even a bit picky about jobs, but it seems difficult to be picky about the current situation.\\n\\n\\nAfter a comprehensive analysis, I can only look at some job recruitment websites, and then try to help improve their resume, etc. Any friends have good ideas, or different suggestions or viewpoints, are very welcome to comment and discuss with me. I didn't say that I can definitely help this, but I still hope that my friend's child can find a suitable job as soon as possible.\\n\\nWelcome everyone to rationally discuss this topic, give some suggestions, and I salute you."}],"type":"content"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"咸吃萝卜淡操心，多管闲事多吃屁","en":"Worrying needlessly, meddling in others' affairs will get you nowhere."}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"1.你朋友对孩子的预期是什么2.这孩子对自己的预期是什么你如果对这两样不了解，你也是白忙。就像楼上说的，如果只是要份工作，那么去送外卖或开网约车都是可以的。毕竟年轻。如果是想坐办公室，那么去找贸易公司或者国际物流公司，从白丁开始做也是可以，大公司别想了，只有私企，看运气遇到个靠谱的老板也是可以的，但起薪比外卖和网约车收入都要少，进去也是民工级别的从最底开始。发达的机会现在几乎没有。","en":"1.

So this industry also has a relatively high number of people who get rich, and foreign trade e-commerce is similar.

Those who come back from foreign countries can indeed get a job more easily, but what about after getting the job? Before getting the job, they'll look at your English. After getting the job, they'll look at your ability to develop business. Most people are destined to get only a basic salary or be fired.

In addition, about the OP, if the parents ask you about employment issues, the subtext might be to see if you have resources, and the opinions may not be important.

During this period, I would carry the child and wash dishes, sweep the floor and mop the floor.... In the afternoon, I clean up the hygiene and coax the child to sleep, and if the child wakes up, I take him out for a walk. At 5 pm, starting to make complementary food for the child and taking the meat out of the refrigerator to defrost. At 6 pm, starting to cook dinner, during which I carry the child and stir-fry dishes, steam rice, etc. After my wife comes back, she helps the child feed complementary food, and after I eat, I wash dishes, sweep the floor and mop the floor.

I am currently in Shenzhen, and my family situation is very ordinary, unable to support buying a house.

This offer requires a change of base location, either Beijing or Hangzhou. I personally prefer Hangzhou, mainly because I feel the housing prices are more affordable, and after struggling in Shenzhen, this 'dry battery city' for almost two years, I feel that first-tier cities are not suitable for me. Hangzhou's pace might be slightly slower.\\r\\n2. My girlfriend of one year is in a certain central enterprise in Shenzhen and cannot easily change her base. She is older than me, has worked in Shenzhen for four years. Although the salary of central enterprises is generally average, the benefits are good, and she can save a little money, but not much. So I am also reluctant to let her give up everything and go with me. Her suggestion is for me to go and take the job, stabilize my work first, be in a long-distance relationship for 1-2 years, and then she can come and join me. But I have already adapted to the rhythm of having her in my life, and it would be a big gap in my life to go to another city without her. Currently, both families are also aware of our relationship, and I personally am developing the relationship towards marriage, so I don't have those 'scumbag' thoughts.\\r\\nAlas, I am very conflicted and also very uncomfortable now.

I called the store in advance to ask about the inventory, and had already informed them that it was an online purchase, as well as the item number. They checked the corresponding inventory and told me I could go directly to the store for the exchange.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, I went to the store with the item and the return slip. The same style was not available in that color. I wanted to exchange it for the same style but different color and size. The clerk told me that the online price and the offline price were different, and the exchange required me to make up the price difference, otherwise they could not provide the exchange.\\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn't agree with this rule, so I contacted the customer service of the official Taobao flagship store. During the process, they asked me a lot of strange questions, such as what the reason was (I replied that the clerk told me to make up the price difference), what the price was in the store now, etc. Finally, it was escalated to a specialist for handling. The specialist called the store, and the clerk told him that it could be done, and it could be successful, but he refused to do it. Finally, the clerk told me that they were selling it for 249 in the store, and I bought it for 99. If they exchanged it for me, they would lose money.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I continued to communicate with Taobao customer service. At first, the customer service said that their system showed that the exchange had been successful. I told them that the clerk refused to exchange it for me. Then they continued to process, and during this time I kept asking how much time it would take, because I had been waiting in the store for more than an hour. Customer service just kept beating around the bush and said they needed time, without saying how long it would take to process, which caused me to keep waiting in the store.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter waiting for about half an hour, at this point I had been waiting for almost 2 hours. The customer service still couldn't give me a clear answer. Helplessly, I could only leave first. After another 40 minutes, the customer service would only repeatedly repeat their return and exchange terms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n>Exchange is only supported for exchanging products of the same style and the same price with different colors or sizes. It does not support exchanging products with different style numbers. If you have purchased products of the same style number and only some colors are discounted, you can only exchange products of the same style number and the same price.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter repeated questioning, the customer service told me that the price should be based on the selling price of the product. In fact, this sentence is also ambiguous. The tag price is the selling price of the product, and the discounted price is also the selling price of the product. I was helpless and could only file a complaint, but they would only say they were sorry and would record it. I think it is completely useless.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the online and offline prices must be consistent before an in-store exchange can be made, then this function is completely useless. What's even more ridiculous is that no one will inform you of this in advance. You only find out that you need to pay the difference when you arrive at the store, and you can't do anything about it. If online and offline prices must be the same to allow an exchange, then you should at least remind and explain, because this condition is actually difficult to guarantee.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am more inclined to believe that this store has a problem. If it does not meet [only supporting the exchange of products of the same style and the same price with different colors or sizes], then they should directly reject my exchange application instead of making me pay the difference. If it is [if you have purchased products of the same style number and only some colors are discounted, the exchange can only be for products of the same style number and the same price], then I can only accept it, but I don't think I am in this situation. The online price reduction is for all colors, and they rarely have such promotions with price reductions for only some colors.

The few remaining items could very likely be sold out when the OP goes there the next day. Furthermore, I think from the perspective of the offline store, there is absolutely no need to reserve the item for the OP, because what if the OP goes to exchange it a long time later, or later decides not to exchange it. From the OP's perspective, assuming 249 is the original price, then 99 is already a deeply discounted price. Based on the traffic in Uniqlo stores, the items could be sold out at any time.

It should be very difficult for the system to match the product you are trying to exchange.

Let me share some tips. 1. Adjust your mindset, first of all, don't be afraid. It's definitely nerve-wracking when you first start driving, but that's a good thing. You need to rest and relieve stress after driving 100-200 kilometers for the first time, and adapt to the pace. Get familiar with the state of your car on the highway. 2. The most common mistake for novices is that they can't grasp the speed. For example, when merging from a ramp onto the main road, there are oncoming vehicles, so signal in advance to tell others you want to change lanes. After merging, try to change lanes to lanes 1 and 2 on the left. Lanes 3 and 4 are generally for large vehicles, which drive slowly and have a speed difference with you. You are prone to rear-ending. 3. Don't change lanes blindly. If the following distance is appropriate and you are not occupying the fast lane (in the beginning, it's better to drive in the second lane on the left on the highway, no one will say anything if you drive a little slower), don't change lanes if it's unnecessary. Changing lanes is cost + risk. 4. Learn to follow cars. If you don't know how to drive, follow others to learn. Driving is something that you get good at with practice. At first, you don't know the level of the car in front, but as you follow more, you will gradually know whether the car in front is driving well, and you will gradually figure it out. 5. Learn to signal. The speed on the highway is much faster than usual, so don't change lanes as soon as you turn on your signal lights. It's best to let all the cars around you know what you are going to do, and then change lanes after about three seconds. When following a car, the high-mounted brake light of the car in front lights up, lightly tap your brakes, even if it's unnecessary, you should also let the vehicles behind you know. Defensive driving is considered to be a more advanced skill. 6. Regard all the cars on the road as idiots, maintain a peaceful mindset, be bold and careful. The most important point is to maintain a safe distance. A longer distance gives you more reaction time, and you have more room to operate."}],"type":"replies"},{"chunks":[{"zh":"高速车少距离远，潜在的危险比市区道路少很多。 比较麻烦的就是开慢车会让车流堆积，所以现在告诉比较危险的有两种，一个是开 S 车的，一个就是开慢车的。相对来说，开慢车比较恶心，只需要三四辆车就可以让一段高速跑不起来。","en":"There are fewer cars and longer distances on the highway, so the potential dangers are much less than on urban roads.
