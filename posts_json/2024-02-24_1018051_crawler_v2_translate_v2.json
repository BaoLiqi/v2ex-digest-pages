Fried eggs take only about two or three minutes, and boiled eggs take a little longer. -------Lunch and dinner staples: Corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes, vermicelli, noodles, frozen dumplings, and frozen wontons are all available, and most can be steamed. Meat: Nowadays, there are those nitrogen-packed large chicken legs online, which seem to have almost no additional additives. Ready-to-eat chicken breast for fitness purposes is also available, but it seems to have more additives and doesn't taste very good. Fruits and vegetables: You can eat more fruits instead of vegetables. Vegetables are also easy to make, blanch them in water, and then add some light soy sauce. When stir-frying vegetables, I usually put more oil, then put some minced garlic, and finally add some salt and MSG, and you don't need to add anything else. -------I often like to stir-fry almost 10 kinds of vegetables together, a little bit of each is enough, and you can cook them to look like a spicy hot pot. See what's in those spicy hot pot stores, and learn to prepare some of them and put them in the refrigerator. The same ingredients can also be used as hot pot side dishes."
