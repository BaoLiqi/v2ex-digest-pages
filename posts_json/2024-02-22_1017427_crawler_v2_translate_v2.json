          "en": "I had a serious experience similar to OP in high school. Basically, it was because I couldn't sleep at night, and my condition during the day was very poor. This made me want to fall asleep quickly when I went to sleep at night, and thinking about it made me anxious. Anxiety made me try to force myself to fall asleep, but the result was that I couldn't fall asleep, and then I became more anxious and felt that sleep was very important and that I had to fall asleep quickly. This made me want to force myself to sleep... This is a cycle. To break it, the fundamental thing is to not take insomnia so seriously, and not feel that insomnia affects the next day's state. To some extent, the anxiety caused by insomnia gives you more negative reminders than the negative impact insomnia itself has on you. Sleep is sound at home because I know I don't have to go to school the next day, and even if I have insomnia, I can just get up late the next day. This makes it easier to fall asleep and not constantly think about getting to sleep."
