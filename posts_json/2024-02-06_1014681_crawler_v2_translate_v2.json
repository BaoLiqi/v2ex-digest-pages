          "en": "Logi's warranty period is 1 year. Now I suspect their products have a planned obsolescence. Here's my experience.\r\n\r\n1. I forgot the model of my first logi mouse. It felt great for 2 years, but the left button broke, prone to double-clicking, which I thought was normal wear and tear.\r\n2. The logi K380 keyboard, purchased more than a year later, wasn’t so lucky. It started outputting garbled characters (sssss) when using save shortcuts just 2-3 months after the warranty expired.\r\nI suspected dust might have gotten in, so I disassembled and cleaned it myself, but the problem wasn't solved.\r\n3. Later, I bought another 2 G304s, one of which had a connector failure a week before the warranty expired. It wasn't recognized.\r\n4. Along with the G304, I also bought a K855 mechanical keyboard. Logically, the keys of a mechanical keyboard should be the most durable, right? I had two other brand mechanical keyboards before; one was used at the office, and one was given to a friend. Both worked for many years without any problems. But this K855, one month after the warranty expired, key 7 became unresponsive, and pasting combined key presses resulted in duplicated pasting.\r\n\r\nOverall, I have used a total of 5 (2 G304) products from them, of which 3 broke down after the warranty expired, and 1 lasted for 2 years.\r\nI was going to contact after-sales service for the k855, but then found out the warranty had expired. Suddenly, I thought of the planned obsolescence, and I don't know if logi is doing that.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's the quality of logi's lower-end products or the issue of planned obsolescence.？Has anyone else encountered this?"
