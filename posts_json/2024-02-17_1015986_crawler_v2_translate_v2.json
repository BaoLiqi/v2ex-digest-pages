Previously, I took the 80 yuan bullet train, which takes an hour to Shenzhen Futian Station. With the 12306 points discount, it's about 95% off, around 76 yuan. If you use a third-party app to bind your 123 account, there's usually around a 3 yuan discount, making it 73 yuan per trip, and almost 300 yuan per month. (This doesn't include Guangzhou and Shenzhen subway fees)\r\n\r\nI tried a Ru Yue bus before the Spring Festival, which cost 40 yuan from Yantang to Futian Station, but it took a long time, almost 3 hours.\r\n\r\n##Question\r\n\r\nAre there any other cheaper round-trip transportation options?\r\n\r\nI feel like there may be no solution, but I still want to ask😅"
