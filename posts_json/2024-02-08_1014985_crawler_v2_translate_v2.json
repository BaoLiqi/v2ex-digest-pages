          "en": "When I went home for the New Year, my brother's child is now in the fifth grade and failed the math and English final exams. I noticed that my sister-in-law tells the child to do two sets of test papers (winter vacation homework) every day, but never corrects them. Once the child is done, he can go play mobile games. I looked at the test papers and found that 90% of the answers were wrong. I was so angry that I almost vomited blood. No wonder he failed the exams, it turned out that he only did the work without feedback, didn't know right from wrong, and thought he got everything right. If that's the case, even if he does ten thousand sets of test papers, he won't improve by even one point.\r\n\r\nMy brother and sister-in-law are both at the level of fifth or sixth graders. They have accumulated some money over the years by doing business in the countryside. They have two cars worth about 500,000 yuan each. The child is now in the fifth grade, and they can't tutor him either. The grandparents are very anxious and want me to think of a solution.\r\n\r\nI think the key problem is someone pointing out his mistakes. The solution I can think of is to use a learning machine, similar to Xueersi learning machine, to help him correct his mistakes.\r\n\r\nI'm writing this to ask the all-knowing V friends if there's a better solution."

That was an epiphany, and from then on, I went to sleep at 12:30 and got up at 5:30. After a whole year, I finally managed to pass the level of a vocational school and got into a bachelor's degree program. Although it wasn't a particularly good bachelor's degree program, it really changed the trajectory of my life. I also thank my family, who, in very difficult circumstances, lent me 1,200 yuan to take tutoring lessons from my own class's English teacher in a small group of three students, which improved my score by 60 points. The aftermath was that I got up too early that year, and there were only bread stalls, so I ate red bean buns and the like for a whole year. Now, I've been working for several years, and I've never bought a red bean bun again; I feel nauseous just smelling it."
