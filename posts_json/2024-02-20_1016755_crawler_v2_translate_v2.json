          "en": "Previously, I also thought that the iPhone's camera was still good, but after buying a camera, I found that 1. The iPhone's HDR is not tuned at all. It's fake, and it only makes you feel amazing when you see it for the first time, but it's tiring to look at it for a long time. The highlights or the daytime sunlight at night are almost overflowing, although HDR makes the bright areas brighter and the dark areas darker, but it needs to be based on real vision, not just to make the bright areas brighter and the dark areas darker. At least the highlights compared to what the human eye sees are fake. The HDR compared to cameras is very real, the highlights will be brighter, but not just stupidly bright, which is more in line with what the human eye sees. 2. Live Photos, a difficult function, started to use it at first, but later found that the videos taken for at least half the time are blurred segments when waving the phone. Maybe I'm just not used to taking a photo and having to stay still for a while. 3. Don't boast about the white balance, the iPhone's white balance has always been green. Even in the same scene, shooting a few more photos will give you a different kind of green. I really don't know how to think that his white balance is good. And it can't even be manually adjusted before shooting. 4. Outrageous sharpening. There is no need to say more about this point, it is really outrageous sharpening. The built-in camera can't be turned off. It's really outrageous. The photos can only be viewed on the small screen of the iPhone, and you can see the sharpening smear without zooming in on the computer. Although I have not actually used an Android phone, I usually go out and play with others and take photos of the same scene, and I have seen the photos taken by others on Android, which are indeed much stronger than the iPhone"
