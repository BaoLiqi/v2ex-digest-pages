          "en": "### Background Information\r\nRecently I bought a 2TB external hard drive, because I also need to connect to the Windows platform for subsequent use, to facilitate the common use of Mac and Windows (Exfat is not considered for data security reasons), I set the hard drive to NTFS format.\r\n\r\n### Software Selection\r\nCurrently anchored Paragon and Tuxera software, the author encountered some difficulties in choosing to buy reading software.\r\n\r\n### Purchase Questions\r\nThere are two doubts about Paragon software:\r\n1. **Regarding the authorization model:** I'm trying Paragon's NTFS for Mac, and it feels good, so I'm going to pay for it. I found that it's a version license, and you need to pay again for subsequent major version updates. I want to ask if the big guys need to pay for one version to use it?\r\n2. **Regarding the purchase channel:** I found that the purchase channels are the official website (USD/credit card payment), or buying from Chinese agent companies, or some third-party platforms. I'm more confused about the latter two, and I don't know what kind of existence they are? I don't know if they are reliable?\r\n\r\nThere are two doubts about Tuxera software:\r\n1. **Regarding the authorization model:** Is the Tuxera version also a one-time payment per version or a lifetime license?\r\n2. **Regarding the purchase channel:** I have found the official website (USD, etc.), third-party platforms, or Taobao (even 10 yuan Tuxera, is this reliable?) I don't know which channel is reliable?\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I also want to know everyone's views and suggestions on the use of NTFS format software on the Mac side, thank you very much. Thank you, big guys! This is my first post, please forgive me if there are any problems."
