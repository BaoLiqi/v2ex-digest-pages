            "en": "So many people upstairs have said so much, and none have explained in detail the mechanism of baldness and the main treatment options. The following is the pathogenic mechanism of androgenic alopecia (AGA) described in common papers: \"The etiology of AGA is multifactorial and multigenic. Scalp hair follicles are one of the target organs of androgens, and abnormal systemic and local androgen metabolism is an important link in the pathogenesis of AGA. Testosterone and androstenedione are catalyzed by 5α-reductase into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which, after binding to the androgen receptor on hair follicle cells, can miniaturize hair follicles. Male AGA (Male Androgenetic Alopecia, MAGA) is an androgen-dependent disease. Although the mode of inheritance is uncertain, obvious genetic susceptibility has been observed. Tosti et al. observed 20 patients with pre-pubertal AGA, and found that they all had a significant family history of AGA, while in female AGA (Female Androgenetic Alopecia, FAGA), the role of androgens is uncertain, with only 1/3 of FAGA women showing abnormal androgen levels. The probability of male hair loss is higher than that of the control group in the first-degree relatives of female hair loss patients, indicating that AGA has a common genetic tendency. Additionally, chronic scalp inflammation, oxidative stress, and inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway are also involved in the pathogenesis of AGA.\" I have also followed this issue, and the conclusion given by most scholars is that methods to promote blood circulation are all useful. Therefore: 1. Combing and massaging the scalp skin is useful, but the force and method should be considered to prevent damage to hair follicles during the process. 2. Methods that stimulate the skin to achieve capillary dilation and activity, such as ginger, are useful, but prevent scalp skin sensitivity and allergies. 3. Minoxidil is useful, but it is often an alcohol solvent and can easily cause allergies. 4. Finasteride and dutasteride can inhibit 5α-reductase, thereby reducing serum DHT levels and inhibiting hair follicle miniaturization. However, one needs to assess whether the side effects of the medication affect their life. No matter how you want to treat it, I recommend that you go to a Class III hospital and seek a doctor to diagnose and treat it with the doctor's treatment plan, do not blindly look for various folk remedies; thank you."

Frankly speaking, it's ineffective involution. Actually, there's not much difference after getting in. I personally saw the interviews and written tests of master's students from the previous one or two batches, the difficulty was just like that, and offers were issued without much difficulty. Now, submitting a resume directly gets rejected. This is the turning point starting in 2023. The employment prospects of universities have also deteriorated sharply. However, it seems that other universities are also like this. It can only be said that a person's ability cannot withstand the wheels of the times.

She took care of the children alone for two days. When her husband came back in the evening, she was still feeding the children.

Seagate and Western Digital are the most mainstream brands. As long as you don't buy models that have design or quality problems, you can buy them from a reliable store that provides after-sales service. I have used 3 Western Digital and 5 Seagate hard drives in my NAS. I had to replace 2 x 3TB Western Digital drives after two years due to expansion, and the remaining 4TB drive is still working normally after 5 years. Two Seagate drives had SMART alerts during the warranty period (but were still usable), and I replaced them directly by warranty. The purchased + replaced drives have been used for 2 months, half a year, 1 year, 2 years, and 4 years respectively, and they are all working normally. So because the number of drives I use personally is too small, the quality difference in statistics is meaningless, it all depends on luck. It is more practical not to buy all the hard drives from the same batch, because the lifespan of the same batch usually fails together. Another thing is to find a reliable store with good after-sales service. Finally, and most importantly, only backups can protect data."

            "en": "I am currently preparing to replace Sublime with it on my Mac, and Sublime is now a replacement for TextEdit for me... while VSCode is a replacement for VS/Xcode (don't tell me about editors and IDEs, for most people, there is no essential difference between domestic chinchillas and industrial-farmed chinchillas), so these two now have different positions. From a big picture perspective, it's best for me if VSCode has a decent competitor, but it doesn't matter if it doesn't, so I don't expect it to replace VSCode. And in reality, there are indeed some defects with Zed currently, such as the fact that it only supports Mac for the time being, and another is that it made me cringe the first time I opened it - software that only targets Mac, and all the text on the UI is actually monospaced! (Although it may not actually be strictly monospaced, there is a saying, “quasi-proportional spacing to allow the font to still feel monospace” - in short, the design intention is still monospaced). You say this aesthetic is made by the people from Atom, it really feels like a joke. The official website is even funnier, using different fonts for different pictures. As for completely replacing VSCode for me, I think various functions are secondary, after all, 80% of people will only use 20% of the functions. In addition to improving the support for major platforms, the following points are very important: # Remote Development or support for Web so that you can use a remote editor in a browser like code-server to support development on the server. These are all in the roadmap, and it will pass if it is done. Of course, there are some subtle differences, such as things like Remote Development or Collaboration, to achieve the best experience, it is best to consider it when designing the underlying architecture of the editor, so it must be a very large thing when it is done, and it cannot be made into a separate plugin. For example, VSCode separately separated an extension host process and then defined a set of RPC protocols. According to the author of the vscode-remote-oss project, the Remote plugin provided by the VSCode official only provides the integration that connects this architecture through SSH (so TA built one himself). Although you may not use Remote, the architecture is still running on the local side, and all operations have to go through RPC. Even the Vim mode function has this kind of problem (one of the top three Issues voted on in VSCode GitHub is about the native Vim mode). Another advantage of VSCode in this regard is that it is written with Web, so it can run directly on the browser, and I have never seen one trying to do DirectUI in the browser that can maintain a certain complexity and at the same time achieve a particularly good experience. # Plugin ecosystem Not only the commonly used plugins, but I also rely more on some long-tail plugins. For example, ccls replaces the official C++ plugin, Codeium replaces Copilot, and OCaml Platform is these niche standard plugins. Although I try to install as few plugins as possible, the above are still key dependencies. These are actually not related to MSFT itself, they are all community-developed. Now when everyone makes a tool, they generally consider at least Vim, VSCode, and Emacs editors. Then there are NeoVim, Sublime, as well as the JetBrains, VS, and Eclipse trio. It is considered a success if a new player can squeeze into the second tier. VSCode has a natural advantage in that it has grown and established a good symbiotic relationship with TypeScript. VSCode is written in TypeScript, and VSCode at the same time provides a good editing experience for TypeScript, and because of the good editing experience provided by VSCode, TypeScript is also easier to promote. Similar models actually appear not only in VSCode, for example, at least before VSCode became popular, some niche language plugins on Emacs could provide a better experience than other editors, such as org is naturally bound, as well as proof-general, merlin, etc., and of course, there are various LISP. One advantage of playing this way is that although people in other languages may not use you, you have a firm grip on the group of this specific language and have a stable base. Zed is not unable to take this road, such as trying to become the de facto development environment for Rust, but it is too difficult in all aspects compared to the precedents of VSCode and TS. # Commercialization plan The essential difference between Zed and new editors that appeared before on the Rust front such as lapce, xi (helix is difficult to compare, because there doesn't seem to be a usable GUI front end), I think, is that Zed was built as a commercial project from the beginning. I started paying attention to the Zed project around mid-January, and I saw their articles on GPU, and then I looked at the editor. I thought it was good at the time but not very interested, because it was not open source, and I would not associate the critical path in my workflow with something that is incomplete and closed source. I didn't expect it to be open-sourced after a week. It seems that the official meaning is that the editor is open source (copyleft GPL/AGPL to prevent others from using it directly, and the CLA requires all copyrights to go to Zed company so that they can use it themselves), and then sell services. There are two problems here, the first is whether this business model is sustainable, such as how much actual demand there is for the only promising Zed Channels (if the Zed itself is well done, we can consider emotional support, but this kind of support cannot cure the fundamental problems of the business model). I actually don't care if Zed Industries can survive, because even if they die, an open-source project can still be given to the community to continue, but if it dies too early, the project is not well-completed and the ecosystem is too poor, then the result is estimated to be worse than Atom. The second is where they will cut next, such as VSCode (and many similar popular open source and non-open source projects from the Nadella period of MSFT) still appears to be using a variant of the old EEE strategy, of course, for VSCode, it can be done only to close source and not charge, but Zed probably can't, if Remote is charged, then it will be quite deadly (although this may actually be a good income). Another situation is that if I am using paid software in my work, I need to report and approve the budget in principle, I cannot buy it privately, and Freeware also needs to be audited for its License, and there will be additional costs in the process."

I recommend replacing it with a 27-inch anti-blue light 2K or 4K monitor. If it's an office environment, then replace it with a 32-inch 4K monitor. As for keyboards and mice, an ergonomic keyboard is definitely useful. An ergonomic mouse also definitely has an effect, but the effect of these two depends on your usage frequency.

The logi K380 keyboard, purchased more than a year later, wasn’t so lucky. It started outputting garbled characters (sssss) when using save shortcuts just 2-3 months after the warranty expired.\r\nI suspected dust might have gotten in, so I disassembled and cleaned it myself, but the problem wasn't solved.\r\n3. Later, I bought another 2 G304s, one of which had a connector failure a week before the warranty expired. It wasn't recognized.\r\n4. Along with the G304, I also bought a K855 mechanical keyboard. Logically, the keys of a mechanical keyboard should be the most durable, right? I had two other brand mechanical keyboards before; one was used at the office, and one was given to a friend. Both worked for many years without any problems. But this K855, one month after the warranty expired, key 7 became unresponsive, and pasting combined key presses resulted in duplicated pasting.\r\n\r\nOverall, I have used a total of 5 (2 G304) products from them, of which 3 broke down after the warranty expired, and 1 lasted for 2 years.\r\nI was going to contact after-sales service for the k855, but then found out the warranty had expired. Suddenly, I thought of the planned obsolescence, and I don't know if logi is doing that.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's the quality of logi's lower-end products or the issue of planned obsolescence.？Has anyone else encountered this?"

Here's the original text from the Shanghai Human Resources and Social Security Bureau's official website, placed below:\"Article 36 of the 'Labor Law of the People's Republic of China (2018 Revision)' (hereinafter referred to as the 'Labor Law') stipulates: 'The state implements a working hour system where workers work no more than eight hours a day and an average of no more than forty-four hours a week.' Article 38 of the 'Labor Law' stipulates: 'Employers shall ensure that workers rest at least one day a week.' The working hour system of 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week is called the standard working system, corresponding to the two-day weekend system implemented by most units, with 8 hours of work per day and 5 days of work and 2 days of rest per week. For some units that can only arrange for employees to rest for one day a week due to work requirements, it is necessary to shorten the daily working hours so that the total working hours of 6 days a week do not exceed 40 hours.   If the working hours exceed 40 hours per week, the excess portion is overtime, and the employer needs to pay overtime pay to the workers in accordance with the laws and regulations.\" One day off a week is illegal, unless overtime pay is given. First, the job market is not good, and second, many people default that one day off a week is acceptable. That's why I just replied saying that only first-tier cities are a bit more normal, since there are more opportunities, and jobs without a two-day weekend will naturally have no one to take them."

Although it wasn't a particularly good bachelor's degree program, it really changed the trajectory of my life. I also thank my family, who, in very difficult circumstances, lent me 1,200 yuan to take tutoring lessons from my own class's English teacher in a small group of three students, which improved my score by 60 points. The aftermath was that I got up too early that year, and there were only bread stalls, so I ate red bean buns and the like for a whole year.

            "en": "Whether a stateful service is suitable for k8s, an important selection factor is the remote storage on k8s. The cloud EBS has several characteristics, such as high performance, three replicas, IO burst, attach, detach, etc. These characteristics depend on hardware investment, such as high-performance network RDMA, which may not be available in a self-built IDC. Therefore, there are some differences between k8s under a self-built IDC and on the cloud, and the difficulty and challenge will be greater. On the cloud, cloud vendors provide cloud instances of stateful services, and the backend has turned to k8s, this direction has occurred, and there is not much controversy. Self-built IDC scenarios have higher difficulty, but TiDB also provides a solution for IDC scenarios TiDB Operator, which relies on local disk LPV, rather than remote storage. LPV is volatile, and TiKV has built-in three-replica features, which just make up for this shortcoming. Similar to this is Kafka's multi-replica mechanism. But for other basic services that do not have three replicas, it is not so easy to enter k8s, and they must face a dilemma: local disks need to solve the multi-replica problem by themselves; remote disks have low performance and will have a large performance loss. It seems very difficult to overcome this performance issue by relying on remote storage itself."

They need to understand the text, convert it into code, execute the calculation, and then give you the answer. I tested it, and Gemini can answer this question correctly and create the correct table. The language model itself still cannot know what the exact answer is. Because this is not the multiplication table. There are no pre-trained materials that can include listing all the rational interest rates of all natural number deposits after all natural years. This question is really boring and there's no need to get hung up on it. It's meaningless. The LLM should be judged by whose language skills are better. Who is good and who is bad cannot be measured by a simple mathematical problem. It requires a lot of application scenarios for comparative testing.

            "en": "Let's talk about the complete conditions for realizing true Dolby Vision support. Hardware: 1. The display supports Dolby Vision. Because Dolby Vision is private certification and authorization for hardware, only displays certified by Dolby can use the private Dolby dynamic metadata in video files to complete dynamic mapping of brightness and color; the display is best with a global maximum brightness of 1000 nits, otherwise the HDR display effect will be robbing Peter to pay Paul. 2. The decoder supports HDR HEVC video decoding, preferably hardware decoding. Software decoding is also feasible, but the CPU requirements for software decoding of 4K or higher HEVC HDR are relatively high. However, as mentioned in the following text, the reality is that only the system player supports Dolby Vision well, and the system player will not use third-party software decoding, so software decoding is meaningless here. Software: 1. The operating system supports HDR and Dolby Vision. The reason is that the dynamic metadata values in video files are private, and the corresponding private dynamic metadata needs to be transmitted to the display when the video frames are displayed. The display needs this data to perform dynamic mapping of brightness and color. Current situation: Windows 11 supports it; you need to go to the settings to enable HDR for the corresponding display and select Dolby Vision mode; macOS basically supports it with Apple's own screens (laptops built-in screens, iMac displays, XDisplay Pro). Some older models may not be supported. Some MacBook Airs have a global maximum brightness of only 500 nits, resulting in a discounted effect. Dolby on the built-in screen does not need to be turned on manually. 2. The player supports Dolby Vision because it involves the transmission of dynamic metadata to the display, and the operating system's display window needs to support an interface for applications to send Dolby dynamic metadata when rendering video frames. macOS has a specific UI layer support; Windows doesn't seem to have one (not sure). Current situation: Currently, it seems that there are no third-party players that have fully supported Dolby in the above methods, and the best may be for Dolby for HLG, discarding the dynamic metadata and playing it as an HDR video in the ordinary static metadata HLG format. The most perfect support is still the system player, Windows 11 \"Movies & TV\" (HEVC extension needs to be installed first). Playing Dolby videos under all of the above conditions will display a Dolby Vision watermark on the window. QuickTime and Movies on macOS."

And no configuration is needed, just use QuickTime to play. Don't bother with formats that QuickTime doesn't support; I haven't seen any third-party players that support it perfectly. 2. Android TVs that explicitly support Dolby Vision. There is basic Dolby Vision support at the Android system level, provided that the hardware manufacturer's display devices and hardware decoders also support it. Therefore, TVs that explicitly support Dolby Vision (some Sony and HTC models) are OK. But when using it, pay attention to whether the TV display mode will be correctly switched to Dolby Vision mode by the app (possibly the Sony display's correction mode). At the software level, streaming platforms Netflix and Tencent Video have no issues. I haven't learned about third-party apps playing their own content. 3. Apple TV + Dolby Vision TV 4. iPhone phones, Android phones that explicitly support Dolby Vision. Forget about the Windows platform. It's rare to see laptops with built-in displays that support Dolby Vision; it's a blessing if HDR is enabled by default and the colors are normal in HDR mode. External displays that support Dolby are ridiculously expensive. It's better to choose a better non-Dolby HDR monitor."

This is the reason for the employment bottleneck for those over 40.

After I finished according to the instructions of the elders at home, I went back to my room. The room door was half-open, and the air purifier, which normally operates in automatic mode, suddenly went to maximum power, with a reading of 200+.\r\n\r\nI have already informed my family that burning incense indoors has a very negative impact on health, but my mother will only strongly ask my father to go to the balcony to close the door and smoke. She herself burns more than a dozen incense sticks every morning indoors and occasionally fumigates with mugwort at night.\r\n\r\nCommunicating with these older people is really tiring. They will only tell you, \"Incense smells fragrant, how can it be harmful to health? Mugwort is originally a medicine, and fumigating with mugwort is the wisdom of the ancients.\"\r\n\r\nI do not object to the religious beliefs of others at all, but you clearly know that it is only harmful and not beneficial to the health of your family, but you can't wake them up at all.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: The above text maintains a neutral stance on any religious and sacrificial activities.

            "en": "First, a little background:\n\nMy hometown is Puning, Guangdong, an 18th-tier county-level city in Guangdong.\n\nThe expectations for buying a house are slightly aligned with my parents; we are hoping for a four-bedroom apartment of about 150 square meters, close to the city center, with complete amenities.\n\nThere are two choices for buying a house now:\n\nMy parents prefer to buy small-property-rights houses (mainly collective housing built by the village here), because they are cheap, and many people buy them there (the average price is now 3000-5000);\n\nI slightly prefer large-property-rights houses, which are easier to trade in the future (although it seems unlikely to trade them? It's hard to say whether I will need to settle down there in the future), and there is less legal risk (small-property-rights houses are unlikely to be compensated to the buyer in case of demolition), (the current average price is 6000-10000, but I can only accept below 8000, my ability is limited, and I am bearish on these small cities);\n\nSo the total budget is 50-120 (small-property-rights houses can be paid in full, large-property-rights houses need to consider installments and mortgages, and under the current interest rate decline, buying it should still be a negative asset), only the unfinished building, and the decoration has to be calculated separately, and it may need to be decorated a little bit.\n\nNow I live in my grandfather's old house (Lao Cuo) in a small rural area below, and a family of 7 can only be said to be able to live there, so it's a necessity. After buying a new house, the whole family can live there (2+2+2+1), which is exactly four rooms. In addition, in the city area, my parents can also choose to change factories and work, and the commute will be closer and they will walk less (of course, I sincerely hope that my parents can work less and rest more, and health is important).\n\nFour first-tier city workers (including me) are all working outside, and one is still studying. In terms of funding, I should contribute 95%, or maybe all of it. My parents earn less working, plus they paid for their children to study before, and they have saved less. The others haven't been out for long, and they have saved less. I've been out for 4 years, and I'm a programmer, so I earn more.\n\nAbout myself:\n\nThe eldest son in the family, an ordinary programmer, has been working in Shenzhen for 4 years. My savings are mainly my salary. In terms of investment and financial management, I have lost 3W in A-shares (including stock funds), and the rest is mainly in bonds and monetary funds. I am still a financial novice. I really want to stay in the big city, but the first-tier house prices are really difficult for a worker like me.\n\nI am still single, and I don't have a partner. I am actually quite conflicted about this house, because it basically drains my savings, but I only come back to live during the Spring Festival, and it is uncertain where I will be in the future. Buying this house has an element of taking care of my parents' face.\n\nFor personal future planning, I am now quite confused. When I graduated, I just started working in a medium-sized factory. I could do test questions and brush eight-part essays after work every day, thinking about entering a big factory in the future. Later, I encountered the contraction and layoffs of big factories, and I couldn't even submit my resume. Later, I went to a foreign company, and the market contracted soon after, and the entire department was shut down. Later, I interviewed at Alibaba, but the HR interview failed. I was quite disheartened about the future. Now I am working in a small company, and I am constantly learning English, but it seems that I don't have a particularly strong motivation to go out. Maybe I will try remote work when I go back to my hometown (uncertain). Occasionally, I think about changing careers to do business, but I have no experience and no idea.\n\nSome questions/help:\n\nAt present, when the stock market, housing market, and population are declining, it's somewhat like Japan's debt recession. Is it appropriate to buy a house at this point? Is it better to buy small-property-rights or large-property-rights houses? In addition, friends who have bought houses in county towns, or relevant experience, please help me, how should I do it?"

You have to go back to your hometown to worship during the New Year and festivals. (This is the custom here, you can't invite the gods over if it's not your own house. And there are many times to worship the gods in a year.) This means that you have to run this journey home through wind and rain. The older generation of parents still value this very much, and it's useless to persuade them. For example: After worshiping at my hometown on the New Year's Eve of a certain year, I packed my things and went back to the rental house. Because no one had lived in the house for a long time, and I didn't have time to go back and clean it before the New Year, so it became like this. (PS: No four-wheel drive, all motorcycles, small electric donkeys, a one-hour journey.)"

Be as loud as you can, but do not physically assault them.

Work reports rely on fabrication and plagiarism.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the leader doesn't understand the technical details, which gives him a lot of room to play. He speaks eloquently in front of the leader, repeating jargon over and over again, and really fools the leader. Coupled with his ability to handle things, the leader has a good impression of him. He's always smiling at colleagues and project management, and accepts criticism and scolding with a sincere attitude every time, but it's still the same afterwards. He presents himself as a good-tempered, hardworking, and nice person to outsiders.\r\n\r\nI'm just a small soldier, and I can't command him at all, but I don't want to give up this project.

However, their understanding of chronic diseases is very different from mine. When they get sick, they just abstain from oil and salt, drink alcohol, smoke, and eat a lot of carbs, selectively believing what the doctor says.\n\nAbout 30% of the elders born in the 70s will control their diet according to the doctor's advice, such as how many ounces of carbs per day, a one-to-one ratio of animal oil to vegetable oil, eating less salt, eating enough protein and vegetables, and supplementing some vitamins blabla.\n\nMost elders still don't listen. I think it's a bit difficult for the grandparents' generation to control their diet, but this generation of parents may be able to significantly improve their physical condition by controlling it.\n---\nNow, other people's parents learn nutrition knowledge themselves, but their own parents don't listen at all. They have a meal of congee and steamed buns, stir-fried potato strips, and then a sweet potato after the meal. It looks very confusing... Their pre-meal blood sugar is indeed still within the range... No matter how they persuade them, they don't listen. They say they've been eating this way for thousands of years.

If it's just because there are too many hard drives and they're obvious, are you considering a 30TB SSD? The price of storing 30TB on BB for 3 years is basically enough to buy two 30TB SSDs, one for transmission and one for backup, otherwise, can the data retrieval be reduced to twice a year using deep glacier?

            "en": "Background:\r\nThis year is 30, an ordinary second-tier engineering male, after graduation, I worked as an engineer in a joint venture small factory in my hometown (a fifth-tier small city in Jiangsu). It's been the eighth year, 855, over 100,000 a year. The work pressure is not high, but there is basically no hope of promotion.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I can keep going, but in recent years, the company's product competitiveness has been getting lower and lower (more and more domestic competitors). In addition, the general environment is not good, and the company is obviously going downhill.\r\n\r\nI wanted to change jobs since the end of last year. Because I work in a joint venture, I have interacted with colleagues from foreign companies a lot, and I can no longer accept the working atmosphere of private companies. I only want to find a foreign company. But in a fifth-tier city, there are not many companies to begin with, let alone foreign companies. If I want to find one, I can only go to a nearby city.\r\n\r\nDuring the Chinese New Year this year, I visited relatives. My wife's cousin is a small sales leader in a foreign company in Wuxi, which is a Fortune 500 manufacturing company. I saw that the company happened to be recruiting a position similar to my major, and the salary might be 20,000 to 30,000 more than mine now. He said that he could help me if I wanted to go. Let me consider it and give him an answer after the New Year.\r\n\r\nProblems faced:\r\nThe biggest problem is that my wife is in a local government public institution. Even if I buy a house in Wuxi in the future, it is unlikely that she will give up her public institution to come over. In this way, I can only go home every weekend, and it takes an hour and a half to get home by highway. If the rent and commuting expenses are deducted, it is equivalent to no increase in income. And there are no children yet, and long-term separation will be a big problem for children's education.\r\n\r\nMy concerns are that I am already 30 years old, and it will only become more and more difficult to change jobs in the future. Now there is a suitable and good opportunity in a foreign company, which will definitely help my personal development. Moreover, the products of my current company are very niche, and most of the knowledge accumulated in the past is industry-specific. If I want to switch to other industries after the company fails, it will be very difficult.\r\n\r\nMy wife suggests that I go. She thinks that as long as the salary is high, it doesn't matter if we live apart. My parents don't recommend me to go. They just want me to live a quiet life here..."

I, myself, found a job I liked and was satisfied with the income in the process of exploring various side businesses. Then, regarding the new job, since there are relatives, I personally think that it is not so urgent that you must make a decision immediately.

I don't know if they are reliable?\r\n\r\nThere are two doubts about Tuxera software:\r\n1. **Regarding the authorization model:** Is the Tuxera version also a one-time payment per version or a lifetime license?\r\n2. **Regarding the purchase channel:** I have found the official website (USD, etc.), third-party platforms, or Taobao (even 10 yuan Tuxera, is this reliable?)

During the New Year, I experienced a few domestic phones from my classmates, and the built-in ads didn't seem as rampant as before.

Based on this requirement, I thought the previous generation of high-end phones would have a higher price-performance ratio, so I looked for a few models with high DXOMark rankings. I went to JD.com and the official website to check the prices; I was shocked.\r\n\r\nFor example, the OPPO Find X7 series was newly released in January 2024, with the lowest configuration selling for 3999; The X6 released on March 21, 2023, also sells for 3999, and the X5 released on February 24, 2022, still sells for 3999.\r\n\r\nI haven't studied the detailed parameters yet, but at least the CPU and memory of the new generation are improved compared to the previous generation. In this case, the previous generation hasn't dropped in price at all. What kind of people would need to buy the previous generation?

            "en": "1) The recognition rate is extremely poor. It basically doesn't work when lying on my side, or when I'm sleepy in the morning, or when I'm lying on a pillow. When cooking, I have to specifically put my face near the phone to make it work > FaceID will learn the appearance based on the recognition results (unlocking manually after recognition failure), thereby improving the recognition rate and speed. FaceID requires complete 3D information of the face. If too much of the face is covered, it will fail directly. If you frequently need to unlock with a partially covered face, it's recommended to record a mask ID, covering the parts below your nose. 2) It severely tests the way I hold my phone. My finger has to swipe up from the very bottom. I can't hold it from the top (why can't it be changed to the Android design where you can unlock it by swiping up from anywhere?) > Because this is Apple's global operating logic, that is, “any place with a ‘white bar’ can be dragged”. Furthermore, swiping your finger on the half screen will conflict with the side-swipe camera, up/down swipe to expand/collapse notifications. And this conflicting logic is because these operations are built on the basic logic of “white bar must be draggable”, rather than a peer-level logic conflict. 3) Since I have to swipe anyway, why don't I just use a fingerprint? I don't quite understand this swiping logic > If you are very fond of fingerprints, you can purchase iPhone 8 or iPhone SE models. iPhone needs to swipe again after unlocking because the display and mask logic of the notification center/lock screen are inconsistent with Android. Android has long lacked the logic of masking notifications on the lock screen (I know it exists now), so Apple needs to perform an additional layer of verification here in order to adopt this mask and unmask logic (unlocking the screen, but not entering the home screen), allowing you  to preview the masked notification content and home screen information, such as medication reminders, personal schedules, etc. – that's right, Apple believes that your medication data and what you need to do today also belong to the privacy that needs to be masked. And Android is usually a “screen on - unlock - enter the home screen” and one-time operation on fingerprint recognition models (or provides a separate skip unlock switch), so there is no such logic of “swiping”. the lock screen notification only has a previewing logic, not a mask/unmask logic. 4) I hope these are posted to encourage iPhone users to break out of their circle and see what's out there.... > Those who use iPhone do have Android phones, so what prompted Android users to switch to iPhone or use iPhone as their main phone? Have you ever thought about it? 5) It doesn't work when lying down, lying on your side, lying on your stomach, putting the phone flat on the table, or when you are sleepy > You can lie down if you expose a complete face with enough recognition range, including lying on your side. Lying on your stomach might be because the distance is too close. Face ID has a minimum recognition distance (about 10 cm), and being too close will cause the infrared light to not fully spread on the face, and the sampling information will be insufficient. Placing the phone flat on the table is possible, and it does not need to be placed upright. It can recognize at 360 degrees from various angles (only for iPhone 13 and newer models that support horizontal screen unlocking, and iOS 16 and above); being sleepy is because your eyes are not open wide enough, or your eyes are relatively small, and you have not obtained sufficient pupil information. A very important point of FaceID verification is to require you to open your eyes and look directly at the screen. The purpose is to resist unlocking attacks when the device owner is not in a voluntary state."

            "en": "Hello everyone, I usually just lurk here. The last time I posted was in 2019 to decide on a job change.\r\n\r\nOne sentence description:\r\n92-born, single, and a senior coder. Should I choose to stay in Shenzhen and continue working at a big tech company as a regular employee, return to Chengdu (where I have a house) to find a partner and get married, or go to Shanghai to work in a good relative's company in a technical management role?\r\n\r\nI graduated from a 985 university (bachelor's and master's degrees) almost 7 years ago. I worked in Chengdu for 3 years before going to Shenzhen, where I've been for almost 4 years. I've always been a regular developer at a big tech company, and my focus has shifted from storage to server backend.\r\n\r\nAs I get older, I'm also anxious about starting a family. Last year, I went on many dates for a whole year, but I didn't find anyone suitable. I couldn't find a reason to stay in Shenzhen, so I'm considering going back to Chengdu after 2024, since I have a house there.\r\n\r\nThen, my uncle's company in Shanghai has just gone public. He wants to find someone trustworthy to help him and asked me if I wanted to go. The technical direction will change again, and he said that after I'm familiar with the business, I'll be assigned to a management position. The initial salary is the same as what I'm making now. I can apply for permanent residency after a year.\r\n\r\nAdvantages and disadvantages of a few choices:\r\n\r\n- Stay in Shenzhen: Advantages: The climate is good, and there are many job opportunities. Disadvantages: You're completely on your own, and the housing prices are high.\r\n\r\n- Return to Chengdu: Advantages: Comfortable, have a house, familiar, and many classmates and friends. Disadvantages: Relatively few job opportunities.\r\n\r\n- Go to Shanghai: Advantages: Some unknown development prospects, rely on connections. Disadvantages: The living environment is even more difficult than in Shenzhen; the technical direction changes again.\r\n\r\nAlas, I deeply understand the ancient saying: a person without long-term plans must have immediate worries.\r\n\r\nI'm probably like most people, a person who is good at planning but indecisive, and I don't have a particular preferred technical area. I crave a happy, joyful daily life, doing the work I'm assigned to do and, with my decent abilities, working methodically, hoping to succeed one day. But frankly, I've found that if you don't have strong goals and opportunities, it's very, very difficult."

The reason why middle and upper levels are not easily replaced is mainly due to the high cost of trust, and also because of their large responsibilities, rather than the replaceability of their job skills. If we assume that everyone is trustworthy, the cost of trust is almost zero. In fact, the job skills of a CTO and a technical manager in a company are far more replaceable than those of an ordinary coder. The factors that determine your income are never what you do, but the level of the pyramid you are on. The key factor that determines your position is not how much you contribute, but who you're connected with. The essence of politics is the distribution of interests, and where there are people, there is politics. In the company, working hard and developing methodically is almost a dream. You can't escape the fate of working hard until you die."

So your question is asked too late. These original choices have become unwise, or missed the opportunity to get on board, in 2024.

            "en": "An old CX-5 2.5 4WD owner. Last year, I switched to a BRZ, and my dad is driving the CX-5. The transmission of this car is really smart, but cars are prone to breaking down if they sit unused. For example, you need regular maintenance, and you have to pay thousands of yuan for insurance, engine oil, transmission oil, brake oil, rear axle differential lock oil, etc., every year. Also, the tires can't be left idle; they are prone to deformation and damage. And tires have a lifespan; they need to be replaced every 5-6 years, otherwise, you won't feel at ease on the highway. A blowout is no joke. Before I gave my CX-5 to my dad, I replaced it with 4 Michelin PS4 tires, one costs a thousand yuan. Buying other cheaper ones also costs about 700 yuan. It's best to drive the car once a week to get the engine oil moving, otherwise, it's prone to sediment. I suggest you rent a car when you need to use one; the cost may be cheaper than keeping a car for a year. However, I haven't rented a car during Chinese New Year either; you have to consider everything."

It's fake, and it only makes you feel amazing when you see it for the first time, but it's tiring to look at it for a long time. The highlights or the daytime sunlight at night are almost overflowing, although HDR makes the bright areas brighter and the dark areas darker, but it needs to be based on real vision, not just to make the bright areas brighter and the dark areas darker. At least the highlights compared to what the human eye sees are fake. The HDR compared to cameras is very real, the highlights will be brighter, but not just stupidly bright, which is more in line with what the human eye sees. 2. Live Photos, a difficult function, started to use it at first, but later found that the videos taken for at least half the time are blurred segments when waving the phone. Maybe I'm just not used to taking a photo and having to stay still for a while. 3. Don't boast about the white balance, the iPhone's white balance has always been green. Even in the same scene, shooting a few more photos will give you a different kind of green. I really don't know how to think that his white balance is good. And it can't even be manually adjusted before shooting. 4. Outrageous sharpening. There is no need to say more about this point, it is really outrageous sharpening. The built-in camera can't be turned off. It's really outrageous. The photos can only be viewed on the small screen of the iPhone, and you can see the sharpening smear without zooming in on the computer. Although I have not actually used an Android phone, I usually go out and play with others and take photos of the same scene, and I have seen the photos taken by others on Android, which are indeed much stronger than the iPhone"

To maintain their status as a recent graduate, they couldn't pay social security (meaning they couldn't sign an employment contract, only intern), and then they might have taken the exam a few times, but they never passed. Then, they just gave up and stayed at home.\n\nBefore the Spring Festival, there was a big argument with the child. The parents meant that the child stayed home all day without looking for a job, living off savings, and probably wanted to stimulate the child. They said some harsh words, saying that if the child didn't look for a job, they would change the locks and not let them come back. This hurt the child's self-esteem.\n\nNow they bring this matter up with me, and I want to help, but it seems difficult to know where to start. The main problems are:\n\n- I don't know what kind of job is suitable for [International Trade] (GPT recommends “trade specialists in import and export companies, supply chain management positions in large multinational companies, or consulting consultants in trade consulting companies”, I don't know if anyone knows).\n\n- After being graduated for so long, they shouldn't have the status of a recent graduate. Without work experience, how can they find a job that matches their major through social recruitment?\n\n- It's not like before. You can just say hello and find a job through connections. Now, big companies have to go through formal interview processes. Even if you have connections, you must meet the minimum education and experience requirements. Directly arranging a job should be impossible. I don't think the chances are high even if I find someone to recommend them internally to a big company.\n\n- Although my friend's child has never worked, they have interned, such as at Alibaba, but they said they didn't like it (it seemed like they felt their personality wasn't suitable). I feel like my friend's child may not be able to endure hardship, and is even a bit picky about jobs, but it seems difficult to be picky about the current situation.\n\n\nAfter a comprehensive analysis, I can only look at some job recruitment websites, and then try to help improve their resume, etc. Any friends have good ideas, or different suggestions or viewpoints, are very welcome to comment and discuss with me. I didn't say that I can definitely help this, but I still hope that my friend's child can find a suitable job as soon as possible.\n\nWelcome everyone to rationally discuss this topic, give some suggestions, and I salute you."

If you do well, you’ll get a lot of commission and even start your own business later. So this industry also has a relatively high number of people who get rich, and foreign trade e-commerce is similar. If you don't do well in foreign trade, you'll only get a basic salary and then be kicked out (most likely). But the Internet is becoming more and more developed, and the information gap is getting smaller and smaller, which is now much more difficult than before. Those who come back from foreign countries can indeed get a job more easily, but what about after getting the job? Before getting the job, they'll look at your English. After getting the job, they'll look at your ability to develop business. Most people are destined to get only a basic salary or be fired. So, I also said above that when he was studying abroad, it was his best chance to try and understand e-commerce, but he missed it. If he does foreign trade, he can only guarantee to be more stable unless he joins those large groups. In addition, about the OP, if the parents ask you about employment issues, the subtext might be to see if you have resources, and the opinions may not be important. If the child went abroad because their grades were not good, the chances of passing the civil service exam are probably not high, so it’s best to try to see if there are any positions in state-owned enterprises that have strong requirements for foreign language skills.

Before and after the 6-week intervention, accommodation function, tear film breakup time, visual acuity, Schirmer test value, macular pigment optical density level, muscle stiffness, and questionnaire were evaluated. 20 subjects per group were included in the efficacy analysis. The treatment group showed a significant improvement in the average pupil response percentage of both eyes and the dominant eye at 6 weeks before and after the operation of the visual display terminal compared to the placebo group. In addition, the active group showed a significant improvement in the scores of \"feeling difficulty in focusing the eyes\" and \"difficulty in seeing objects or details in the hands or nearby\" before and after consumption compared with the placebo group.

Taking care of a child mainly requires effort and mental energy, and it doesn't have a high threshold. 2. If the grandmother is old and lacks energy or is in poor health, you can hire a nanny, and the grandmother can supervise the work. The standard in Shanghai should be similar to Shenzhen, 6,000~10,000. Grit your teeth and hold on until the child is old enough for a nursery. 3. Now some nurseries also accept babies a few months old, and you can send them to work and pick them up after work. I don't know the fees, I just know that this thing exists, you can ask people around you or the community. 4.

After three years old, the child goes to kindergarten during the day and we take care of the child at night. A: This is feasible in most cases, but you have to do a good job of communicating with your mother, what is harmful to the child, how to hold the child correctly, and the precautions for milk powder and diapers. Before the age of 1, the baby still needs a lot of attention. 2. Hire a nanny, but worry about the nanny's character and patience, after all, it's not their own child. A: Do you think hiring a nanny is cheap? It's equivalent to cutting a knife out of your finances. 3. I or my wife take care of the child full-time, which will lead to insufficient financial resources and make life more difficult. A: Be cautious, unless one of you or your wife has a stable source of income if one of you or your wife loses income, neither of you has any objections to spending the other's money (it seems that it will be a problem after a period of time), and it will be uncomfortable to return to the workplace, or it will not be so smooth to return to the workplace (otherwise, why are so many mothers asking for help online?). In essence, taking care of a child alone is a very tiring and trivial thing. My child is just one year old, and I took care of him for almost 7 days during the Chinese New Year: at 7 am, the child woke up to drink milk, drank 200 ml of Aptamil milk powder, changed clothes, and put on pull-up diapers. I looked like a sleepy dog, brushed my teeth and washed my face while carrying the child. Next, I put the child in a safe place and changed my clothes, then took the child for a 15-minute walk, during which I would play with the child until about 10:30, soon the child was sleepy and wanted to sleep around 11:10. At this time, getting up to prepare ingredients, preparing lunch and feeding the child at the same time. At 12 o'clock, the meal is ready, but I have to eat it quickly. During this period, I would carry the child and wash dishes, sweep the floor and mop the floor.... In the afternoon, I clean up the hygiene and coax the child to sleep, and if the child wakes up, I take him out for a walk. At 5 pm, starting to make complementary food for the child and taking the meat out of the refrigerator to defrost. At 6 pm, starting to cook dinner, during which I carry the child and stir-fry dishes, steam rice, etc. After my wife comes back, she helps the child feed complementary food, and after I eat, I wash dishes, sweep the floor and mop the floor. At around 8 pm, give the child a bath, at this time the child is covered in dirt, I can only wash off the stains by hand first and then wash it with a washing machine, and then hand it over to my wife... it's too much. During the period, the child performed quite resistant, every moment I wanted to give him a slap."

If any V friends remember OP, they should remember that I previously posted a thread asking for your advice on how to get into a big company. Fortunately, I was lucky and after countless interviews over half a year, I finally landed a full-time offer from a big company.\r\nNow the reality is:\r\nOP is from Hubei, 24 years old.\r\nI previously had two jobs, both outsourced development positions at big companies. I am currently in Shenzhen, and my family situation is very ordinary, unable to support buying a house. Although my family gives me a lot of freedom and accepts that I can settle down in other cities and don't require me to go back to Hubei, as a young man from the countryside, I still really want to buy a house and put down roots in a big city (second-tier, not considering Beijing, Shanghai, or Shenzhen).\r\nConflicts:\r\n1. This offer requires a change of base location, either Beijing or Hangzhou. I personally prefer Hangzhou, mainly because I feel the housing prices are more affordable, and after struggling in Shenzhen, this 'dry battery city' for almost two years, I feel that first-tier cities are not suitable for me. Hangzhou's pace might be slightly slower.\r\n2. My girlfriend of one year is in a certain central enterprise in Shenzhen and cannot easily change her base. She is older than me, has worked in Shenzhen for four years. Although the salary of central enterprises is generally average, the benefits are good, and she can save a little money, but not much. So I am also reluctant to let her give up everything and go with me. Her suggestion is for me to go and take the job, stabilize my work first, be in a long-distance relationship for 1-2 years, and then she can come and join me. But I have already adapted to the rhythm of having her in my life, and it would be a big gap in my life to go to another city without her. Currently, both families are also aware of our relationship, and I personally am developing the relationship towards marriage, so I don't have those 'scumbag' thoughts.\r\nAlas, I am very conflicted and also very uncomfortable now. I ask all the older brothers and sisters to give me some advice."

Second, your girlfriend's parents are afraid that their daughter will have a hard time in a first-tier city and want her to return to her hometown in the north. That is to say, the possibility of her settling down in Shenzhen is actually not very high, so she might give up her job in the central enterprise later on. Considering the above two points, what you should do now is: 1. Go to Hangzhou, 2. Stabilize your girlfriend, don't let the long-distance relationship ruin things, 3. After working for two years, you two can consider together where to settle down (you have to face the problem of not being able to adapt to life without your girlfriend, there's no way out). Finally, to add one point, your personal future is the most important thing. If you don't have a good future, you won't be able to keep the person you want. Between staying in Shenzhen and not being able to afford a house, losing your girlfriend, and going to Hangzhou and having a long-distance relationship and losing your girlfriend, in these two worst-case scenarios, at least you have a future to strive for if you go to Hangzhou."

            "en": "A few days ago, I bought a pair of pants at Uniqlo, they were too small, so I decided to exchange them and was told that I could exchange them in the store. I called the store in advance to ask about the inventory, and had already informed them that it was an online purchase, as well as the item number. They checked the corresponding inventory and told me I could go directly to the store for the exchange.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I went to the store with the item and the return slip. The same style was not available in that color. I wanted to exchange it for the same style but different color and size. The clerk told me that the online price and the offline price were different, and the exchange required me to make up the price difference, otherwise they could not provide the exchange.\r\n\r\nI couldn't agree with this rule, so I contacted the customer service of the official Taobao flagship store. During the process, they asked me a lot of strange questions, such as what the reason was (I replied that the clerk told me to make up the price difference), what the price was in the store now, etc. Finally, it was escalated to a specialist for handling. The specialist called the store, and the clerk told him that it could be done, and it could be successful, but he refused to do it. Finally, the clerk told me that they were selling it for 249 in the store, and I bought it for 99. If they exchanged it for me, they would lose money.\r\n\r\nSo I continued to communicate with Taobao customer service. At first, the customer service said that their system showed that the exchange had been successful. I told them that the clerk refused to exchange it for me. Then they continued to process, and during this time I kept asking how much time it would take, because I had been waiting in the store for more than an hour. Customer service just kept beating around the bush and said they needed time, without saying how long it would take to process, which caused me to keep waiting in the store.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting for about half an hour, at this point I had been waiting for almost 2 hours. The customer service still couldn't give me a clear answer. Helplessly, I could only leave first. After another 40 minutes, the customer service would only repeatedly repeat their return and exchange terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n>Exchange is only supported for exchanging products of the same style and the same price with different colors or sizes. It does not support exchanging products with different style numbers. If you have purchased products of the same style number and only some colors are discounted, you can only exchange products of the same style number and the same price.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter repeated questioning, the customer service told me that the price should be based on the selling price of the product. In fact, this sentence is also ambiguous. The tag price is the selling price of the product, and the discounted price is also the selling price of the product. I was helpless and could only file a complaint, but they would only say they were sorry and would record it. I think it is completely useless.\r\n\r\nIf the online and offline prices must be consistent before an in-store exchange can be made, then this function is completely useless. What's even more ridiculous is that no one will inform you of this in advance. You only find out that you need to pay the difference when you arrive at the store, and you can't do anything about it. If online and offline prices must be the same to allow an exchange, then you should at least remind and explain, because this condition is actually difficult to guarantee.\r\n\r\nI am more inclined to believe that this store has a problem. If it does not meet [only supporting the exchange of products of the same style and the same price with different colors or sizes], then they should directly reject my exchange application instead of making me pay the difference. If it is [if you have purchased products of the same style number and only some colors are discounted, the exchange can only be for products of the same style number and the same price], then I can only accept it, but I don't think I am in this situation. The online price reduction is for all colors, and they rarely have such promotions with price reductions for only some colors. Moreover, the store has always said that the reason is the price inconsistency, rather than the color issue.\r\n\r\nFinally, does anyone have any channels for complaints or reports? I wasted nearly 3 hours for this result."

From the OP's perspective, assuming 249 is the original price, then 99 is already a deeply discounted price. Based on the traffic in Uniqlo stores, the items could be sold out at any time.

It should be very difficult for the system to match the product you are trying to exchange. Even if the system can recognize it, it will recognize the selling price as 99, and then exchange it for 299, the system level will intercept this operation, and the staff may not be able to operate it at all. Even if the store manager has the authority to exchange the product, the resulting difference is likely to be handled by the store itself."

Work is a drudgery that makes you feel pain, and to alleviate the work, you spend the money you earn on some small things that may not be of much use, and for this you need to do more work, so that this pain continues. Of course, this book takes a very extreme angle to criticize consumerism, and some of the views in it are a matter of opinion. For me, compared to buying some small things to bring myself happiness, and then finding out one day several years later that I have spent a lot of money on a pile of useless things in the house, I would rather save the money and go traveling with my parents and friends, or buy some large items, learn a skill, and so on."

During off-peak hours, there are many straight roads on the highway, with few people, so of course it is easy to drive. The difficulty of the highway lies in the peak hours when there are many cars, and the speed is fast (greater than 80), the distance between vehicles is close, and it is easy to be cut in if you are too far away. This situation is the most prone to accidents. This kind of road is relatively difficult to drive. Another type of road on the highway that is prone to problems is going from fast to slow, such as lane narrowing, or congestion ahead, which requires rapid deceleration, this requires the driver to predict the road conditions in advance. The OP should choose to drive more on the main roads of your city, such as Binhai Avenue in Shenzhen, during peak hours. Note that it's not during traffic jams, but during peak hours. The vehicles are dense, and the speed is around eighty or ninety kilometers per hour. If you drive on this road for a week, you will have no problem on the highway."

            "en": "I just drove 1600km alone during the Spring Festival, and I've been driving for a year. Let me share some tips. 1. Adjust your mindset, first of all, don't be afraid. It's definitely nerve-wracking when you first start driving, but that's a good thing. You need to rest and relieve stress after driving 100-200 kilometers for the first time, and adapt to the pace. Get familiar with the state of your car on the highway. 2. The most common mistake for novices is that they can't grasp the speed. For example, when merging from a ramp onto the main road, there are oncoming vehicles, so signal in advance to tell others you want to change lanes. After merging, try to change lanes to lanes 1 and 2 on the left. Lanes 3 and 4 are generally for large vehicles, which drive slowly and have a speed difference with you. You are prone to rear-ending. 3. Don't change lanes blindly. If the following distance is appropriate and you are not occupying the fast lane (in the beginning, it's better to drive in the second lane on the left on the highway, no one will say anything if you drive a little slower), don't change lanes if it's unnecessary. Changing lanes is cost + risk. 4. Learn to follow cars. If you don't know how to drive, follow others to learn. Driving is something that you get good at with practice. At first, you don't know the level of the car in front, but as you follow more, you will gradually know whether the car in front is driving well, and you will gradually figure it out. 5. Learn to signal. The speed on the highway is much faster than usual, so don't change lanes as soon as you turn on your signal lights. It's best to let all the cars around you know what you are going to do, and then change lanes after about three seconds. When following a car, the high-mounted brake light of the car in front lights up, lightly tap your brakes, even if it's unnecessary, you should also let the vehicles behind you know. Defensive driving is considered to be a more advanced skill. 6. Regard all the cars on the road as idiots, maintain a peaceful mindset, be bold and careful. The most important point is to maintain a safe distance. A longer distance gives you more reaction time, and you have more room to operate."

The location is Guangzhou, and an experienced driver always sits in the passenger seat on the highway. The experienced driver told me about driving on the highway: 1. Don't stay in the leftmost or rightmost lanes, there are people overtaking in these two lanes 2. Do not drive abreast with other cars, especially trucks. If there is a truck in the adjacent lane, and there is a car in front of you, slow down and wait for the car in front to overtake the truck until there is enough distance for you to overtake the truck and still maintain a safe distance, then decisively accelerate to overtake the truck 3. When you are following a car, try not to bunch up, it may not be driving abreast with other cars, but the road conditions ahead are very good, and only a few cars near you are bunched up, you must decisively overtake and go ahead, in case a car in the bunch brakes suddenly, those with slow reactions will get hit 4. Change lanes in advance, do not change lanes across more than one lane, be honest, protect yourself, and don't harm others. When the navigation prompts that there are vehicles merging from the right (there is an exit prompt, and basically passing the exit is the entrance for merging), change lanes to the two lanes on the left in advance, many cars cannot speed up when merging into the main road (maybe not because the driver does not want to speed up, but because the car accelerates slowly) 5. Be more Buddhist, an experienced driver with more than 20 years of experience told me that road rage is useless, because you can't do anything except ranting pointlessly, just curse a few words, relax, safety first from the starting point to the end point"

Also, practice going through tunnels (only the tunnels in Guangdong have lights, the lights in other provinces are small) and going on and off the ramps (drive at whatever speed the navigation says).

Playing cards is also a form of entertainment, averaging 30,000 to 40,000 a year. They are old and have no other hobbies. This amount of money is just for entertainment.

The difference between 800,000 yuan and 500,000 is still huge. Some people who caught the opportunities of the times might think it's expensive to spend 800,000 yuan on a car, but many people can grit their teeth and buy the 56E for 500,000 yuan. Although the 56E doesn't cost 500,000 yuan in these two years, I was blown awake by the cold wind on the way home from the subway. 500,000 is still too much for me. I just paid off the mortgage last year, and I'll have to take out a loan again for this car. The days of paying off the loan are still too torturous. Parking in Shenzhen is also expensive.
